random_article = """*The following is an adaption of a presentation I give to YC startups before we have them create their presentation\nslide decks for Demo Day.*\n\n**Here’s how to make a solid Demo Day slide deck. The thing to remember is that you already have everything you need to\ncreate a great presentation.**\n\nThere are probably 100 reasons why your company is great, but people can only really remember a few of them after a\nshort presentation or pitch. With each one of you, we sat down and figured out the 5 to 7 most important ideas people\nshould know about your startup. These 5 to 7 points are the ones you want investors to remember.\n\nAs you experienced for yourselves from <span id='r1'>Prototype Day</span> [1.](#e1), you’ll be lucky if they can\nremember even 1 or 2 of those points in the context of 100 other companies also presenting alongside you.\n\nIf you just communicate your points clearly, you’ll do better than 99% of startups. Because before anyone can remember,\nthey have to understand. Here’s how I make things easy to understand:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.125.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-125\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097395\" />\n\n  - I make it legible.\n  - I make it simple.\n  - I make it obvious.\n\nHere’s how to get people to **not** understand:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.013.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-013\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097368\" />\n\n  - Making it illegible.\n  - Making it complicated.\n  - Making it subtle.\n\nI’m going to hammer this in with some repetition: Your slides should **NOT** be illegible, complicated, or subtle.\nSlides should be legible, simple, and obvious.\n\nThis is when I give a word of warning before moving forward in my presentation. **This presentation has too many damn\nslides.** If this was an actual Demo Day presentation, I’d have stopped a few slides ago. This is a visual essay, which\nis very different. Please don’t make a visual essay.\n\n**Legibility**\n\nAlright, let’s talk about legible slides. If they can’t read it, they won’t be able to understand it. At Demo Day, the\nroom will be filled with over 500 people. They can’t all sit in the front row. A good number of them are old-ish people,\nso their eyesight may not be the best.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.022.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-022\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097369\" />\n\nLegible slides are ones that even old people sitting in the back row with bad eyesight can read. Here’s how you do that:\n\n  - Use large type.\n  - Bold text.\n  - A simple font.\n  - With good contrast from the background.\n\nAlso, text at the top is easier to read from the back of the room. Let’s run through some examples.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.029.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-029\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097370\" />\n\nThis is not exactly terrible. The problem is the contrast and the positioning of the text. Let's try it again.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.031.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-031\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097371\" />\n\nIt's better, but there's lots of other text on this slide that's not optimized for legibility because we've allowed the\nscreenshot to be a constraint. Here's a version I know everyone will be able to read from the back of the room.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.033.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-033\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097372\" />\n\nThe following slide comes from [Shred Video](http://shredvideo.com/). It's from their Prototype Day presentation\n(*thanks guys for giving me permission to use this*) and it's the one that's supposed to explain what their startup is\nbuilding.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.034.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-034\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097373\" />\n\nAs you can see (or not see), the text is too small and too skinny. The text that actually explains what they do is also\nat the [bottom of the slide](/images/ddaytips/ddaytips.034.png). Their technology is amazing. Shred's software can\nautomatically edit videos from hours of raw footage into something that looks like it was made by a professional in just\na few seconds. Unfortunately, they've basically hidden it in light gray at the bottom of the slide. By Demo Day, their\ndescription simplified and the text they used to describe it was large and in charge.\n\n**Simplicity**\n\nLet’s talk about simple slides. Simple ideas are easy to understand.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.038.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-038\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097374\" />\n\nBut what does that exactly mean? Well, simple and complex share the same word origin.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.039.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-039\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097375\" />\n\nThe word ‘plex’ means braid or twist or fold.\n\nSimple ideas are ones that aren’t intertwined with other ideas. They are one fold. They are one idea. A simple slide,\ntherefore, expresses one idea. Do not crowd your slides with multiple ideas. That’s how you make it complex. Some ideas\nmay take more than one slide to express a point, but you should try hard to do it in one.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.042.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-042\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097376\" />\n\nSince you only have 5-7 ideas you want to get across to investors, you shouldn’t have too many slides. Demo Day slides\nideally have only about 5-7 slides.\n\nLet's look at another example from one of our startups. Here’s a very early version of a slide from\n[Afrostream](https://afrostream.tv/) explaining what they do.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.047.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-047\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097377\" />\n\nThey've put two ideas here trying to convey what exactly they've built and who it's for. Unfortunately, there's just too\nmuch text here. It might have been okay if they had just put the highlighted portions, but they made a very common\nmistake that I see a lot of startups make. They've tried to pack in all the little nuances of their business into this\nslide. The result is a slide that no one can easily remember.\n\nContrast this with the slide they end up using on Demo Day to explain their startup:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/afrostream-after.jpg\" alt=\"afrostream-after\" width=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097366\" />\n\nAhhhh, it's like a breath of fresh air. Short, sweet, and easy to recollect. Once you decide what idea you're going to\ntry to convey on a slide, you've got to figure out how to make sure your audience finds that idea. The best way to help\npeople find the one idea on each slide is to make it obvious.\n\n**Obviousness**\n\nLet’s talk about obvious slides. Obvious slides are ones that can be understood at a glance. Here’s a simple test you\ncan use to test if a slide is obvious: Show it to a stranger and ask them to tell you what it means. If they don’t\n**immediately** say your idea, you lose.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.056.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-056\" width=\"1920\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097379\" />\n\nThis is because ideas that are obvious are very fast to understand. Why do we care about the speed of understanding?\nWell, for a Demo Day presentation the following two things make it very tricky for you.\n\n1.  You only have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\n2.  People are easily distracted.\n\nIn fact, investors are even more easily distracted than most other people. They are easily distracted because they are\nimpatient. If they don’t get your point right away, they will check their email.\n\nWe can’t force investors to stare and listen to you the entire time. And to be honest, it’s hard to focus intently on\nover 100 presentations even if it’s your job. Have some empathy\\! The way to mitigate this is to make sure any slide you\nshow can be immediately understood. That way they’ll just get it when they look up from checking their email.\n\nHere’s how I make things obvious: I start by making it **legible** and **simple**. (See two points above.) Then I try to\nmake my idea **explicit**. Here’s an example:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.072.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-072\" width=\"1920\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097380\" />\n\nmarkdown: That slide isn’t explicit. You can probably guess and figure out it represents some kind of growth graph, but\nit isn’t immediately clear.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.074.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-074\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097381\" />\n\nThis is better, but the idea I want to express could be more in your face.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.076.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-076\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097382\" />\n\nBoom. It's like I put CliffsNotes right on the slide. No need to guess how my startup is doing, I made it explicit.\nHere’s another variation from one of our startups.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.079.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-079\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097384\" />\n\nWithout the caption, you’d have to study the graph to get to that conclusion. Just writing it out like that means I\nbarely have to look at the graph at all.\n\nAnother way I make my slides obvious is to avoid distractions in my slides. Now, when I say distractions, I mean\ninformation distractions. Here’s one way to show how Dropbox works:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.084.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-084\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097385\" />\n\nNot bad, but not obvious. The problem is people can’t understand that slide immediately. Why? Well, there’s a lot of\ninformation on that slide. See?\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.087.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-087\" width=\"1920\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097386\" />\n\nAll that crap takes time to comprehend. There’s actually a law of human interaction called [Hick's\nLaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law) that describes how each piece of information we add to a problem comes\nat a cost–-increasing the number of choices will increase the time it takes to make a decision logarithmically.\n\nTo me, diagrams are like little mazes for ideas. It usually makes the path to the idea you want to express too long. And\nyou don’t want investors wasting time trying to figure out a diagram. You want investors to just understand\nimmediately—immediately why you’re awesome. So the path to the idea should be straight and quick.\n\nHere’s some other distractions you should avoid in your slides.\n\n  - Too much text.\n  - Excessive explanations and caveats.\n  - Excessive branding per slide.\n  - Photos with no titles or captions.\n  - Animations.\n  - Transitions.\n  - Memes.\n  - Subtle humor.\n  - Accidental humor.\n\nBasically, don’t try to make the slides the thing they’ll remember.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.107.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-107\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097390\" />\n\nInvestors invest in teams not slides. Your slides should make **your** ideas more clear. Don’t let your slides distract\ninvestors from what you’re saying out loud. You want them to be impressed by you. Not your slides.\n\nThere is, however, one exception I have for this rule: when your point is to show complexity or to overwhelm the\naudience. This usually happens when a startup wants to talk about how hard a problem is that they're solving. I’ll give\nyou an example from [Magic’s](https://getmagicnow.com/) slide deck.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.092.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-092\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097388\" />\n\nOn that slide they make the point that their software abstracts away thousands of services into a single interface. To\nbring the point home, they show a slide of every on demand service they could think of in every industry, market and\nvertical organized on a grid.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.093.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-093\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097389\" />\n\nNormally, it's not ideal to show a slide of every potential competitor out on the market. The logos, however, represent\nthe problem. For users to take advantage of all these services, they'd have to create an account for every single one.\nIt's a discovery and usability issue. Each logo also represents every business Magic is now able to charge a premium on\ntop of to solve their users' problems. It's overwhelming for a reason and that's usually when it's okay to bend the\nrules.\n\n**Fucking Screenshots**\n\nLet’s talk about screenshots. I usually hate screenshots in Demo Day presentations. Screenshots are almost always\nillegible, complex, and non-obvious. They break all 3 rules\\! The text in most interfaces are too small (not legible).\nMost interfaces do multiple things (not simple). Most screenshots take longer than a glance to understand (not obvious).\nThey are the worst.\n\nHere is a Google image search for\n[‘screenshots’](https://www.google.com/search?q=screenshots&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIhoqquqadyQIVSfJjCh1diQB8&biw=1204&bih=1356):\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screenshots.png\" alt=\"screenshots\" width=\"960\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097396\" />\n\nCan you understand any of those images immediately? Nay.\n\nIf you’re trying to show what you do, I recommend showing the most simplified version of it. A bulleted list of steps is\nmy favorite technique for this.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.118.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-118\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097391\" />\n\nThat slide is far better at explaining the ease of use of [SparkGift's](https://www.sparkgift.com/) product than any\nworkflow they could show from their actual interface. Sometimes a company can get lucky and explain what they do in two\npoints. Here's how [Meadow](https://getmeadow.com) did it:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.119.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-119\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097392\" />\n\nIn my opinion, this slide is far better than any combination of buttons, links and chrome they could have put up there\nto express the same idea.\n\nThe frustration I have for screenshots in pitch decks goes for screencasts and videos as well. Think twice before trying\nto use either one.\n\nAlright, so there’s probably a lot more you can do to improve your slide deck, but this is a pretty good start. Again,\nhere’s how to make a solid Demo Day slide deck:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.125.png\" alt=\"ddaytips-125\" width=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097395\" />\n\nMake it legible. - Make it simple. - Make it obvious.\n\nIf you just do these three things, you’ll have a presentation that anyone can probably understand. And since\nunderstanding is the foundation for getting someone excited enough to want to talk to you afterwards, it’s a good place\nto start.\n\nTwo weeks into a batch we hold an event called Prototype Day for all the startups to present to one another for the\nfirst time. What they realize quickly is how bad they are at describing their startups in a way that gets even their\nbatchmates to remember. [↪](#r1)\n"""


random_article1 = """Many hackers-turned-founders understand that sales is an important and valuable skill, but shy away from doing it out of\nfear and uncertainty.\n\nWhat if I told you that being a great enterprise salesperson requires the same skill set as being a great hacker? You\njust need to reframe how you think about sales.\n\nBefore I get started, I want to point out that this article is focused on early stage companies — those who are still in\nthe \"wild west\" stage of figuring things out and do not yet have an established repeatable sales process and\norganization. That said, I assume you have found product-market fit, or are close to\nit.<sup id=\"footnoteid1\"><a href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup>\n\nHackers are experts at understanding complex systems and bending them to their\nwill.<sup id=\"footnoteid2\"><a href=\"#footnote2\">2</a></sup> Large enterprise sales requires the same skill set, but\napplied to a different kind of system.<sup id=\"footnoteid3\"><a href=\"#footnote3\">3</a></sup> Where a computer system is\na complex network of **hardware and software**, a large enterprise is a complex network of **people and\nprocesses** — and it can be understood and influenced in the same way. The emergent behavior of a corporation is\nthe result of incentives and structured rules amongst its constituent people, much like the output of a computer system\nis the result of structured rules and data flows between pieces of code.\n\nEnterprise sales, then, involves understanding and influencing the components (people) of the system in order to produce\nthe desired behavior (buying your product.) Every system (company) is different, and so you need to develop a systematic\napproach to hacking (selling to) them.\n\nThis is especially true in the early stages of a startup. A mature company has generally figured out how to hack most of\nthe possible systems in its target market and has created scripted processes to make it a rinse-and-repeat sales model.\nTo follow the analogy through, in this way you can consider the typical \"coin operated\" sales person at a mature company\nto be more akin to a [script kiddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) than a hacker.\n\nUsually the more complex the system, the more satisfaction the hacker feels when he or she pwns it. Great news:\nEnterprise sales systems are really complex, and hacking them can be much more difficult than hacking computer systems.\nThis is because the components don’t always operate according to structured, rational rules. They are humans with\nemotions, which means you also have to understand their motivations, hopes and fears. If that additional chaos isn’t\nenough, consider that the feedback cycle is much slower when hacking an enterprise vs. hacking a computer system. This\nmeans you need to be much more methodical in your approach -- brute force is generally not an option -- and you don’t\nhave as many chances to make mistakes.\n\nBelow I will offer some tips on hacking the enterprise. But first, it’s useful to point out some of the typical objects\n(people) you can expect to encounter in the system and their respective incentives and concerns:\n\n  - **Champion.** A champion is your ally within the target company. He or she will have have deep familiarity with the\n    pain your product solves, and will hope that your product is the solution. When you give your pitch, you will find\n    the champion nodding along and completing your sentences for you.\n    \n    The champion will do everything he or she can to get your product deployed at the company, but their influence\n    depends on their seniority and authority. While line-level champions are great, you also need to find champions who\n    are director-level and above. Champions may become so excited they will want to quit and join your company (it has\n    happened to me multiple times), and in any case, a champion often acts as if they are one of your employees — they\n    are your guy/gal on the inside.\n    \n    These people are gold. Find them early and build strong relationships quickly.\n\n  - **Detractor.** The opposite of a champion is a detractor. For some reason, these folks really don’t want to see your\n    solution deployed at the company. Maybe it threatens their job. Maybe they are already invested in a competing\n    product. Maybe they built the solution that is currently being used. Figure out who these folks are early, and\n    generally try to stay off their radar. You need to rally enough support from champions and other parts of the\n    organization to overpower any detractors.\n\n  - **IT.** There are two types of IT organizations you may run into: The risk avoidant organization that perceives\n    change as threatening and risky for the business, and thus shies away from it, and the forward-thinking IT\n    organization that is programmed for risk taking and embracing change. Unfortunately, the former is a lot more common\n    than the latter at large enterprises, and for this reason it’s usually a good strategy to avoid talking to IT\n    (unless your product’s users are in IT.) It’s usually easier to get a meeting with IT compared to a business unit,\n    but be warned, these meetings can end up leading you astray. Some IT groups don’t actually understand the true needs\n    of the business — I’ve been burned by this in the past, building features that IT have asked for in order to get a\n    deal done only to discover when putting the product in front of actual users that it wasn’t what they wanted.\n    \n    Your strategy should generally be to avoid IT until required to go through security reviews and other approvals, and\n    by this time you should have the business units \"pulling\" you so strongly that IT can’t slow things down for too\n    long. There are of course exceptions to every rule. I have worked with some phenomenal IT people in the past who\n    ended up being real champions and helping us get deployed across different parts of the business.\n\n  - **Procurement.** If you are lucky enough to convince a decision maker/budget holder to buy your product, you will\n    usually be handed over to procurement to negotiate the deal. Get ready for some pain, because usually these folks\n    are incentivized to get the lowest price possible (though there are always exceptions.) Just make sure you are\n    prepared to \"give\" them something — once they extract their pound of flesh they will get out of the way. This is one\n    reason why a lot of enterprise software has a ridiculously high \"list price\", but discounting by 80% or more is\n    standard practice.\n\n  - **Legal.** As you run the gauntlet you will likely encounter legal next. Their weapon of choice is often\n    exhaustion — sending back endless redlines over clauses in the contract that in reality won’t have much impact.\n    Your best strategy here is to decide up front what you really care about and what you are willing to give on.\n    \n    After you’ve done a round or two of redlines, a good strategy is to have a frank and authentic discussion listing\n    out those things that you care about, and give in on the stuff that won’t really make a difference for you. That,\n    combined with strong support from your champion (who should be in the background telling legal to hurry up and get\n    the deal done), will help you close out the negotiation and get a signature.\n\n  - **Finance.** You may not need to interact with finance directly, as they may just talk to procurement, but it’s\n    important to aware of the motivations of the finance team. One thing they are thinking about is the budget and\n    budget cycle. For example, you may find that the finance team prefers to pay more money up front to use up some of\n    this quarter’s budget, rather than to space out payments over time. Also important is whether they have a preference\n    for capex or opex, which will influence whether they prefer to make a lump sum payment for a purchase of software vs\n    paying monthly license fees. This affects your pricing model as well as the structure of your sales team and comp\n    plans.\n\n-----\n\nNow that you have some sense about what the components of the enterprise system look like here are a few tips for\nhacking it:\n\n**Uncover the motivations of every player.**\n\nIn the beginning you should devote a lot of time to listening and learning. Map out the people in your target company,\ndraw a diagram. Just like a great hacker spends a lot of time poking around, exploring and understanding how a system\nworks before attempting to influence it, you need to spend a lot of time really understanding the organization,\nmotivations and interactions.\n\n**Build strong relationships with your champion(s).**\n\nWhen doing a large enterprise deal it will fall through before it closes, maybe more than once. You will need to lean on\nyour champions to revive the deal and keep it moving. You need to turn these champions into your friends — you should be\nable to text them any time of night and ask for their help. Your champions are your best entry point into influencing\nthe system.\n\n**Hire the right type of sales people.**\n\nNow that you understand what selling to the enterprise is like, you should make sure you hire the right people given the\nstage of your company. Personally I tend to optimize for skills and raw characteristics over experience. An especially\ncommon problem is hiring the wrong fit for your stage - for example, hiring a \"coin operated\" script kiddie salesperson\nout of a large company when you really need a hacker. You want people who are comfortable with uncertainty, who can\nlearn quickly, and have strong intuitive and intellectual intelligence to understand the system well enough to influence\nit.\n\n**Keep your map front and center.**\n\nYou spent time mapping out the system in advance. Now, you must always keep it in mind, especially when strange things\nseem to be happening. Go back and evaluate the different people, their motivations, and their interactions. Figure out\nhow to play the system to your advantage, and inject the right messages in the right places. Position your product in\nthe right way to the right people at the right time. This is where the art of selling comes into play so I can’t give\nconcrete tactical advice here, other than to draw your awareness to the fact that it is where most of the magic happens\nin sales.\n\n**Engage on many fronts.**\n\nIt’s a good practice to create pairs of relationships. For example, pair executives at your company with executives at\nthe customer, your engineers with their IT and security folks, your product people with their business unit leaders etc.\nThat said, always make sure one person (usually the account executive) is overseeing and coordinating all the\ninteractions.\n\n**Instrument your process.**\n\nIt’s important to instrument your sales process (collecting data and generating reports) in the same way you would use a\npacket sniffer or debugger when hacking. You need to measure your sales process in order to improve it.\n\n**Don’t forget that companies are people too.**\n\nIt may seem like one organization selling to another organization. But really, decisions are made by people, and people\ndon’t always act rationally. You can use this to your advantage by building the right relationships as described above,\nor it can blindside you and cause a deal to blow up if you don’t have the correct understanding of the people involved\nin the system. Remember that friendships lead to partnerships. Remember also that friendships often transcend the\nemployer. By nurturing these relationships they will pay off across multiple companies.\n\nI hope this perspective on enterprise sales encourages more hacker founders to get out there and sell their products\nmore effectively.\n\n*Ryan Junee is an entrepreneur, startup advisor, and investor.

random_article2 = """Across the globe, as the novel coronavirus moves us from communal spaces into the confinement of our homes, our social\nexperiences are forced to adapt. Beyond the social networks we already know and use, we are finding new ways to\nintegrate social into our online lives. At Y Combinator, we are considering what this might mean for the future of\ne-commerce. For several years, we have had our eye on Pinduoduo as an interesting case study. But now, as China is\nrecovering from the impact of COVID-19, Pinduoduo and their social-shopping approach is even better poised to fully\ncapture the offline-to-online transition in commerce. The success of Pinduoduo in China suggests there is a huge\nopportunity for social commerce platforms to emerge in other regions.\n\n**But first, a bit of background**\n\nWhen Pinduoduo launched in 2015, there was little room for a new commerce platform in China. Two major e-commerce\nplatforms, JD and Taobao/TMall (sub brands of Alibaba), dominated online commerce in China, much like Amazon dominates\nin the US. During that same year, JD and Taobao generated a combined $433B of gross merchandise\nvalue.<sup id=\"footnoteid1\"><a href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup> And yet, five years later, Pinduoduo is defying\nexpectations, skyrocketing from a start-up to\na 57<sup id=\"footnoteid2\"><a href=\"#footnote2\">2</a></sup>-billion-dollar-company with an active buyer base of 585\nmillion that generated over $144B of Gross Merchandise Value in the last twelve\nmonths.<sup id=\"footnoteid3\"><a href=\"#footnote3\">3</a></sup> In 2020, it is China’s second largest e-commerce platform\non an active user basis only lagging behind Alibaba.\n\nPinduoduo found room in e-commerce, not as a competitor to search-based websites like JD, but as a new e-commerce\nplatform focused on interactive and social shopping experiences online. Social shopping may seem like a new concept, but\nthe reality is that in the physical world, shopping is meant to be “interactive and fun” and purchases are regularly\ninformed by friends and family. Consider how much harder it feels to purchase a new clothing item without immediate\nfeedback from friends. E-commerce platforms like JD, Alibaba, and Amazon don’t account for this. Instead, they optimize\nfor efficiency, funnel conversion, and purchase rates. Pinduoduo, on the other hand, has tried to mimic the offline\nshopping experience online by building community via their team purchase model, driving engagement via fun and\ninteractive games and rewards, and offering personalized experiences and value via recommendations.\n\nConsumers’ desire for social engagement while shopping is highlighted by sales within categories. Only 29% of\napparel, 11% of health & personal care, and 3% of food & beverage purchases were expected to happen online in 2020 in\nthe US (compared to 55% and 43% of books/music and computers/electronics purchases,\nrespectively<sup id=\"footnoteid4\"><a href=\"#footnote4\">4</a></sup>). These numbers reveal a missing element in\ne-commerce. Social shopping is particularly important for categories where consumers seek feedback or recommendations\nfrom friends. Pinduoduo is one of the first companies to successfully create a social shopping experience online, and\nhas accelerated the transition of commerce from offline to online in China.\n\nIn our view, Pinduoduo’s rapid success in social commerce will be replicated by others globally, which will continue to\ndrive commerce in social-driven categories online. And so, to understand the success of Pinduoduo is to understand the\nfuture of global e-commerce.\n\n**Creating Community via Team Purchase**\n\nThe core of the Pinduoduo experience is team purchase, where buyers form a group in order to receive discounts from\nsuppliers. The user experience, as laid out in the graphic below, is as follows: (1) for each item, merchants decide two\nprices – one for individual purchase and one for team purchase. If the user opts for a team purchase, he or she may\neither (2.1) initiate a team purchase, or (2.2) join an existing team purchase. If the user has initiated a team\npurchase, he or she may use social platforms such as WeChat to proactively encourage friends to join their team (3.1) or\nmore passively wait for other buyers to join the purchase on the Pinduoduo (Pinduoduo) platform (3.2). A team needs to\nbe formed within 24 hours to have the order confirmed. Once a team is formed, the purchase is confirmed and the product\nis shipped within 48 hours.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PDD-Overview.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1004\" height=\"495\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104308\" />\n\nNearly all Pinduoduo transactions are completed using team purchase. In the early days, the size of many groups was\nlarge (e.g., 10+), but as Pinduoduo has scaled the group size requirements have declined. Team purchase is beneficial to\nboth buyers and manufacturers; buyers benefit from better prices for goods they want and sellers benefit from increased\ndemand and better visibility of future demand. In addition to driving down prices, team purchase helps solve the “trust\ndeficit” of retail in China’s developing cities, where more\nthan 80%<sup id=\"footnoteid5\"><a href=\"#footnote5\">5</a></sup>) of retail is unorganized and consumers rely heavily on\nsocial recommendations to initiate transactions.\n\nPinduoduo’s team purchase is often compared to Groupon in the US because they both enable a form of group buying. But\nthe models are actually very different. First, Pinduoduo deals are designed by sellers, but initiated by consumers\n(i.e., users must create or join a group of a certain size to access a deal) whereas Groupon deals are designed and\nmanaged by sellers. Second, Pinduoduo’s team purchase is used for everyday goods (e.g., fruits/vegetables, apparel) that\nare valuable to consumers vs. one-off products/experiences that haven’t sold well elsewhere. Third, products on\nPinduoduo are offered by geographically diverse merchants from across China and increasingly from all over the world.\nThis is in contrast to the mostly local sellers that leverage Groupon to drive customers to their stores/locations. This\nresults in a much stronger consumer value proposition as users are getting discounts on goods they might need to\npurchase anyway vs. letting sellers dictate discounts by aggregating demand on low-value goods or excess inventory.\n\nTo maximize this effect, Pinduoduo launched in the fruits and vegetables category. This was strategic for two\nreasons: 1) incumbents were focused on non-perishable items, so competition was limited and 2) fruits and vegetables are\nlower order value, high frequency goods, which means users had a reason to use Pinduoduo regularly. When potential\nbuyers saw a great deal they would forward it to their neighbors and friends via WeChat to create a team of 10+ buyers\nto be able to purchase the product. In return, the group initiator would get produce for free as they helped Pinduoduo\nacquire 10 incremental users. Because team purchase drove organic sharing of the product, Pinduoduo was able to grow its\nuser base very quickly. Only one month after launching their first party application in January 2016 (transactions prior\nto this happened via WeChat), Pinduoduo already had over 10 million customers. Only four years later, Pinduoduo has\ngrown to 585M active buyers. To compare, Alibaba crossed the 500M active buyer threshold 14-15 years after launching its\nconsumer facing marketplace vs. just 4 years for Pinduoduo. The take away for startups is that the team purchase model\nis significant because it enables behaviors associated with offline commerce (e.g., sharing products or ideas with\nfriends, browsing a shopping mall with friends) in an online setting. Team Purchase helped Pinduoduo grow quickly and\ncreate a unique recommendation engine based on users’ social interactions. While Team Purchase may be unique to China\ntoday, we expect social e-commerce to be global. New commerce platforms that can leverage social relationships will\naccelerate the offline to online transition and if you are able to tap into groups of social relationships vs.\none-to-one relationship the faster your platforms will scale. PDD has one of the most powerful network effects in the\nworld ([Reed’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law): The value of a group-forming network is proportional to\nnumber and the ease with which groups form within it. Think Slack, WhatsApp Groups -- they all grew exponentially as\nthey could tap into groups of social relationships)\n\nWhile Team Purchase was the main reason for Pinduoduo’s rapid growth, a significant enabler of Pinduoduo’s virality was\nthe widespread use of WeChat as a platform in China. Tencent (WeChat’s owner) is a large investor in Pinduoduo, and as a\nresult was happy to let Pinduoduo grow on top of their ecosystem. We think it is highly unlikely that Facebook would\nallow a social commerce application like Pinduoduo to be built on top of Messenger or Instagram in the US. That said,\nmessaging is fragmented in the US, so this is not an issue for US-based social e-commerce companies.\n\nUsers visit Pinduoduo without any specific intent, much like visiting a real-world shopping mall. In a shopping mall,\nthe time that a consumer spends at the mall directly correlates with the amount he or she buys. As such, Pinduoduo has\ngamified the experience to maximize the amount of time a user spends on the app irrespective of whether they make a\npurchase or not. The primary features/experiences that have incentivized sharing and usage are Daily Check-Ins, Price\nCuts, Card Programs, and Mini Games. Social commerce does not just mean connecting user accounts to Facebook. It means\ninvesting in creating physical world experiences online -- specifically bringing the fun of shopping offline to online\nplatforms. We will walk through how Pinduoduo has implemented this below.\n\n**Daily check-ins**\n\nThe daily check-in is a feature, prominently featured in the center of the home page. It encourages daily usage by\nrewarding users with redeemable points each time he or she checks into Pinduoduo. The user experience is laid out in the\nimage below. First, the user clicks the yellow icon to administer a check-in. Each time the user checks-in they are\ngranted a small amount of money and/or credit. Over many months (and many check-ins), these rewards accumulate. In the\nexample below, the user has accumulated 26.6 RMB of rewards. To cash out in the form of a no minimum spend voucher, the\nuser has to reach a certain minimum value (i.e., 30 RMB).\n\nThe daily check-in is a simple yet brilliant feature that encourages users to engage with Pinduoduo on a daily basis.\nWhile each check-in does not generate revenue for Pinduoduo, the product experience eventually ties back to commerce\nif/when users redeem their vouchers. This theoretically should yield a higher customer lifetime value for Pinduoduo.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104298\" />\n\n**Price Chop**\n\nPrice Chop is a feature that allows users to get products for free by sharing a custom link with their friends. The\nfeature is outlined in detail below. Once in the Price Chop section of Pinduoduo, the user selects the goods that they\nwant for free. Upon selection, a 24 hour timer begins. To get the item for free, the user must share their link with as\nmany friends as possible. Every friend that clicks on the link and engages with Pinduoduo (no purchase required) drives\nan incremental discount for the initiator. If you don't reduce the price to 0 within 24 hours you don't get the item for\nfree and you have to start all over again\\!\n\nThe product mimics the experience of “leveling” in a massive online multiplayer game like World of Warcraft whereby it\nbecomes harder to level up as you graduate to higher levels. In the case of Pinduoduo, the difficulty is customized\nbased on the user (i.e., easier for low-engagement users) and the item (i.e., expensive items are more difficult to\nchop). Additionally, similar to leveling, as you get closer to 0 (i.e., a higher level) each incremental friend that\nengages with your link grants smaller and smaller discounts.\n\nSimilar to Daily Check-In, Price Chop encourages users to engage with Pinduoduo, and eventually ties the engagement to\nan order on the commerce platform. But unlike Daily Check-In, Price Chop incentivizes users to share Pinduoduo with\ntheir social network. So in addition to increasing customer lifetime value, Price Chop also helps Pinduoduo efficiently\nacquire customers via user-user sharing of the product.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104299\" />\n\n**Card Program**\n\nPinduoduo’s card program is designed to encourage users to share the product amongst friends and to save money via\nvouchers/special discounts. Pinduoduo has created several different cards that either (1) encourage certain user\nbehaviors or (2) provide utility to a Pinduoduo user. The three most popular cards are the Free Pass Card, the Black\nBrand Card, and the Brand Card.\n\nThe Free Pass Card is similar to a loyalty program where users can enjoy a “team purchase discount” without having to\njoin a team. Users usually get one Free Pass Card after making two purchases on Pinduoduo.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104300\" />\n\nThe Brand Black Card encourages users to leave reviews on the platform by offering them a discount on branded products\nin return. Pinduoduo gives users a Brand Black Card after they have posted 2 - 4 reviews on the website. This is\nimportant as consumers rely on reviews and recommendations from previous buyers when making purchase decisions. The\nBrand Black Card incentivizes a good user behavior that makes the platform better for the entire user base.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104301\" />\n\nThe Brand Card aims to promote Pinduoduo’s branded products. Consumers get a Brand Card after they have made a purchase\non Pinduoduo. They can share their brand cards with friends via WeChat, to attract their friends to browse and buy\nbranded products from Pinduoduo. It is an effective way to encourage users to buy branded products they would not\nnormally buy because the recommendation/card was sent to them by a trusted friend.\n\nThis is also important because Pinduoduo has historically been used to primarily buy non-branded products. The Brand\nCard is an effective incentive mechanism to increase Pinduoduo’s branded product market share in China.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104302\" />\n\n**Mini Games**\n\nPinduoduo wants users to engage with the platform as often as possible, and they want the experience to mimic real-world\nshopping. As such, they want users to engage with the app to have fun, even if it does not immediately translate into a\npurchase. Pinduoduo now hosts in-app games to help drive up daily time spent on the platform. The first popular game on\nPinduoduo was Duo Duo Orchard. Think of Farmville except now the rewards are real physical goods. The game is simple – a\nuser creates and nurtures a virtual fruit tree to eventually yield a real box of fruit shipped to his or her address. It\nalready has more than 11M DAUs\\!\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1104303\" />\n\nThough not multiplayer, Orchard has social cooperation aspects that drive up network engagement as well. Once users\nchoose a tree to create (e.g., mango, lemon, macadamia nut), they need to nurture the tree with water and fertilizer.\nThe more you shop on Pinduoduo the more water droplets you receive to nurture your tree. To encourage more interactions\nwith friends, you can also share the water droplets. Team purchases and sharing product links enables users to obtain\nspecial tools like a water can, decorations for your orchard, or bags of fertilizer, which accelerate the growth of your\ntree. Pinduoduo is expanding its in app game selection. It recently launched DD Bank, a piggy bank game where users\naccumulate exchangeable coins over time.\n\nGames like Duo Duo Orchard and DD Bank are ingenious because progress or “leveling” is tied to behaviors that drive\nfinancial goals for the company. By encouraging users to play games on Pinduoduo, they are able to create a win-win-win\nsituation for merchants, consumers, and themselves. More specifically, merchants see more volume, consumers have fun and\nreceive unique discounts, and Pinduoduo generates revenue.\n\n**Creating Value by Offering Personalized Recommendations**\n\nLastly, unlike search-based platforms, Pinduoduo is highly personalized and recommendation based. This means that users\nvisit Pinduoduo without any specific intent, much like visiting a shopping mall in the physical world. Based on\ninformation such as who a user’s friends are, what their favorite categories are, and which of their friend’s they\ntrust, Pinduoduo can make recommendations that are personalized to each user. Pinduoduo is uniquely positioned to do\nthis due to user-user sharing of the product caused by Team Purchase. The data aggregated by the platform allows the\ncompany to optimize what items a user encounters on the app by highlighting (1) products that trusted friends have\nalready purchased or recommended and (2) products in a users’ favorite categories. For new customers, the standard\npractice is to show new users different categories (based on what they know about that user and their friends) and see\nhow they interact with those categories. This is then used to create your buying persona and helps inform future product\nrecommendations.\n\nBeyond offering personalized product recommendations, Pinduoduo also thinks about value-for-money as a personalizable\nconcept. Based on a user’s purchase/browsing history, Pinduoduo knows whether a user values high-cost branded clothing\nor low-cost non-branded clothing. Based on a user’s specific buying persona, Pinduoduo will only show you clothing items\nthat match your willingness to pay.\n\n**The Future of Global E-Commerce**\n\nThere is a huge opportunity for companies to build social into their commerce platforms to take share from transactional\nplatforms and expand e-commerce’s overall share of spend. The success of team purchase may be specific to the commercial\nlandscape of China, but the insights Pinduoduo has surfaced about social integration in commerce is likely entirely\nuniversal. Going forward, when building their products, founders should consider the insight that shopping is a social\nactivity. Web 1.0 platforms - including Amazon - optimize for efficiency and don’t serve trust-based categories very\nwell. We firmly believe that by building sharing use cases and fun experiences that mimic the fun of real-world shopping\ninto products, commerce’s offline to online transition will accelerate.\n\nThere are large indicators that there is major demand for more sophisticated social commerce in the US marketplace\nalready. An obvious example of this is Instagram, which has over one billion users and is now, arguably, one of the\nworld’s largest social shopping platforms. Similarly to Pinduoduo, Instagram has fostered a browsing-based feed from\nfriends and influencers of things that might interest consumers, often accompanied with links to purchase. The rise of\nthe social media influencer economy alone shows that US consumers are ready to fully engage in social online shopping.\n\nIn fact, we have already seen a few companies come through Y Combinator who are trying to fill this void.\n[Snackpass](https://www.snackpass.co/), a food app for college campuses, has built social experiences into their\nproduct. Students can send gifts to each other or hatch virtual pets together by ordering food via the app. These\ninteractive experiences encourage increased usage of the company’s product. [Meesho](https://meesho.com/), a reseller\nmarketplace in India, lets its customers create microbusinesses by selling products/goods to their friends and family\nvia Whatsapp and other messaging channels.\n\nCompanies like Amazon will continue to grow in market share, for specific shopping needs. But it is inevitable that\nsomething will rise to fill the e-commerce-social browsing void in the US market. And the half-hearted attempts some\nretail platforms are making to bridge that gap are not yet cutting it. Social commerce does not just mean connecting\nuser accounts to Facebook, it means creating new shopping experiences for buyers and sellers online.\n\nMeanwhile Pinduoduo’s social commerce is only gaining sophistication and market influence. Pinduoduo has already\naggregated enough consumer insights that they are able to collaborate with and influence manufacturers in China to cater\nto their user base. If there is a gap in the US e-commerce market, it is not just an opportunity to grow domestic online\nretail. As the pandemic drives the worlds' social lives to the Internet, there is an undeniable opportunity for\ncompanies to build social into their commerce platforms to accelerate the offline to online transition globally.\n\n*Special thanks to the Pinduoduo team and Chloe Gordon for reading and editing multiple drafts of this essay.*\n\n<b id=\"footnote1\">1.</b> 20-F filings, 1USD:7CNY conversion rate [↩](#footnoteid1)  \n<b id=\"footnote2\">2.</b> As of April 30, 2020 [↩](#footnoteid2)  \n<b id=\"footnote3\">3.</b> As of December 31, 2019 [↩](#footnoteid3)  \n<b id=\"footnote4\">4.</b> eMarketer [↩](#footnoteid4)  \n<b id=\"footnote5\">5.</b> YC company data [↩](#footnoteid5)\n """


random_article3 = """In the early stages of working on a startup, there is little time to spend on areas other than product development and\ntalking to users. However, as you start to hire people and build a team, there are HR fundamentals worth investing in.\nHaving basic HR practices in place can help your startup scale quickly and may eliminate unforeseen and often costly\nproblems down the road.\n\n## The People Person\n\nMany founders ask me “when is the right time to hire a HR person?”. My recommendation is around 20-30 employees or after\na Series A round. Bringing on a dedicated HR person earlier than this may make sense for some companies if they intend\nto scale their workforce quickly or for other reasons; for example, a non-exempt workforce that needs managing. (See\nbelow for more information on “classification.”)\n\nIn the absence of dedicated HR, there should be someone on your team acting as your “people person.” This person is not\na founder and acts as a sounding board or liaison for your team. Having a people person that your team can come to and\nvoice their concerns is important. This person should have good judgment, be intuitive, and know when to escalate\nissues. It is not their job to solve HR issues, but rather to receive feedback from your team and keep a pulse on\ncultural issues that may be brewing.\n\nThis is not to say employees should not be encouraged to speak with their founder(s), though often employees are not\ncomfortable doing so and need another outlet. Providing your team with multiple ways to voice their concerns may help\nyou resolve issues faster and promote a culture of transparency and open feedback.\n\n## Hiring\n\nThere is little need in the early stages to have a robust hiring regime, however, a few hiring fundamentals can go a\nlong way.\n\nFirst, appointing a person to manage your hiring pipeline and keep candidates moving through each phase of the hiring\nprocess is a good idea. Your hiring experience provides insight into your company culture and a positive candidate\nexperience may be the reason a candidate accepts one offer over another. For those candidates who are unsuccessful,\nclosing the loop with them is important and shows that you respect their time and appreciate their interest in your\ncompany.\n\nSecond, create a hiring plan and formulate a set of questions for each interviewer during the onsite. Too often the same\nsurface level questions are asked over and over again when there's no internal interview plan. Each interviewer should\nplay a role in the hiring process and deep dive into different areas of the candidate assessment for eg. culture fit,\nsoft skill assessment, technical assessment, management approach, working style, and communication.\n\n## Classification\n\nIn recent years, the classification of personnel has been a hot topic. It is important that your workforce is classified\ncorrectly. Classification categories include regular full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees that are\neither exempt or non-exempt. Other classification categories include W2 employee versus 1099 contractors and\nconsultants. YC company [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) has some helpful information on its Help Center regarding [Employee\nClassification\nOptions](https://support.gusto.com/team-management/team-payments/pay-rates/1001671771/Employee-classification-options.htm).\nThe CA EDD also has a [worksheet](https://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de38.pdf) to determine if a worker is most likely\nan employee or independent contractor.\n\nMisclassification can be a costly mistake with potential back payment and penalties. Keep in mind that there are\nspecific laws for nonexempt workforces pertaining to meal breaks, overtime, and holiday pay that your company must\nadhere to despite the size of your team.\n\n## Payroll & Benefits\n\nEmployee benefits are a big overhead expense for startups. In the early stages, you don’t have to offer a full suite of\nemployee benefits from day one, though keep in mind that quality benefits are a drawcard for many potential candidates.\n\nTIP: Offer a silver or gold tier base plan with an optional buy-up plan. Often startups pay 100% of premiums for a base\nplan (generally a silver or gold tier plan) and give employees the option to enroll in a higher tier plan, with the\nadditional cost of the premium paid by the employee. This approach helps startups anticipate their employer costs while\ngiving flexibility to employees.\n\nAs for payroll, keep it simple. I’m a big fan of providers such as [Gusto](https://gusto.com/),\n[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/) and [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/) that administer both payroll and\nbenefits in one portal. When assessing payroll and benefit providers, look at the amount of backend administration\nneeded, available integrations such as 401(k), Flexible Spending Accounts and bookkeeping services, and the tools\navailable to employees such as dashboards, calculators and online support.\n\n## Company Handbook\n\nA company handbook outlines the policies and procedures that govern your company. It outlines policies such as paid sick\nleave, paid time off, parental leave and other state and federal mandated laws. An acknowledgment form is signed by each\nemployee, confirming that the employee 1) received the handbook, 2) has read and understands the contents of the\nhandbook and 3) will adhere to the policies in the handbook.\n\nTIP: Outside legal firms often provide free company handbook templates to their clients. The template forms the basis\nfor your handbook and can be easily customized. YC Company Human Interest has a free [Startup Employee Handbook\ntemplate](https://humaninterest.com/blog/startup-employee-handbook-template/) available on its site and note handbook\nexamples from Zappos, Valve and The Motley Fool.\n\n## Onboarding Process\n\nOutlining a clear onboarding process from when a candidate accepts an offer to joining your company will provide a\npositive introduction and get your new employees up and running quickly. Some startups use an “Onboarding Guide” to help\neducate their new employees. An Onboarding Guide outlines all the need-to-know items such as what internal tools the\nteam uses, team Slack channels, where to find important information, employee benefits, perks and where to find the\nsnacks (always important).\n\nHub has published [The Ultimate Guide for Onboarding for Lean\nStartups](https://blog.thehub.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-employee-onboarding-for-lean-startups/) including helpful\ntips, tools and a timeline for successful onboarding.\n\n## Terminations\n\nIt’s inevitable that you will have people leave your company, whether voluntary or involuntary. It is important to have\na process for offboarding to ensure the employee that is leaving receives their final paycheck (including all\nreimbursements, commissions, bonuses, etc), company equipment is returned and IP is protected. A separation agreement\noutlines the conditions of the termination and may include a separation amount. It is a good idea to use your legal\ncounsel for guidance and ensure your separation agreement is updated according to the specific situation at hand.\n\nLastly, exit interviews are a good way to get insight into your company culture and areas that need more attention.\nSometimes the feedback from exit interviews can be good, bad or downright ugly. Despite the type of feedback, having\ndata points and examples of positive or negative aspects of your company is a big plus and may help you make important\nchanges.\n"""

random_article4 = """This is advice for people who have done scientific research at a university and are considering starting a company to\ncommercialize it.\n\nAt YC, we've funded more than 75 companies in this situation. We also recently went on a [Bio\nTour](https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-bio-tour-2020/) where we went around to research universities and talked with\nhundreds of students and professors in the life sciences about commercializing their research. These are the most common\ntopics founders have asked us about.\n\n## Deciding who should spin out\n\nIn a typical spin-out situation, there are several people who worked on the research, including a mix of students, post\ndocs and faculty. The first thing you need to decide is who is going to work on the company and who is going to stay at\nthe university.\n\nA lot of scientific founders have misconceptions about how to structure their founding team. Here are the most common\nones.\n\n*Misconception 1. You can start a company while continuing your academic career*\n\nHere is a blunt fact that often makes founders uncomfortable: your company has little chance of success unless someone\nwho worked on the original research is willing to leave their university role to start this company.\n\nIf you are a student graduating soon, you can just wait until you graduate; that’s a perfect time to start a company.\nBut otherwise, at some point you will have to make an intentional decision to leave so you can run the company.\n\n*Misconception 2. You should find a CEO to run the company*\n\nToo many scientists believe that they should remain in academia and find a CEO to start a company around their\ninvention. This is almost always a bad idea. For one, it’s hard to find a great CEO to run a company at this early\nstage. Truly great CEOs are scarce, and they usually have much better opportunities available to them than running an\nidea-stage startup with no funding. As a result, most scientists that try this approach either never find a CEO or end\nup settling for a mediocre one. It’s even worse if your university tries to find a CEO for you.\n\nBut even if you could draft any person in the world to run your company, it still probably wouldn’t be a good idea. The\nbest CEO for this stage is one of the people who did the original research. The people who did the original research\nwill be far more invested in the success of the venture than any outsider. They are also far more qualified to build a\ncompany around it because their domain knowledge of the field is much more valuable than whatever general business\nskills an outside CEO would bring.\n\nA related misconception is believing that the research is done and that all that’s left is to commercialize it. If this\nwere true, perhaps an outside CEO would make sense. However, it rarely works out that way. Usually you find that the\nthing the market wants is not quite the thing that you’ve invented, and that more research needs to be done. The\noriginal inventors can take this feedback and make adjustments; an outside CEO will just be stuck.\n\n*Misconception 3. You need someone with business experience on the founding team*\n\nMany scientists think that to start a company you need someone with prior business and financial experience. This is\njust not the case. In the first couple of years, there is typically very little \"business\" to be done, and whatever\nbusiness skills you need you will pick up along the way. Most of the scientists we fund at Y Combinator have no prior\nexperience in business.\n\nPeople who work in business like to make it sound hard, as if business were like quantum physics, a field that needed to\nbe studied for years to master. The fact is, it's not even close.\n\n*Misconception 4: You should raise money first, then leave the university*\n\nOften, people are unsure of whether they want to risk leaving a stable academic role to pursue a startup. So they take\ntheir idea and pitch it to some local VC firms. They figure if it's a good idea, the VC firms will fund them, validating\nthe idea and giving them a smooth transition out of their university job and into a well-funded company.\n\nWhile VC firms will occasionally fund spin-outs this way, usually they don't. Unfortunately, too many founders get\nturned down by VCs and conclude that their idea must be bad and give up. Actually, the issue is that it's just too early\nat this point to raise money from VCs.\n\nTypically, founders will need to work full-time on their company for 1+ years before it is ready to raise a\nmulti-million dollar round from VCs. In the meantime, they sustain themselves by self-funding from their savings,\ngetting government research grants, raising a small amount from friends and family, or raising a small \"pre-seed\" round\nfrom angel investors, accelerators, or seed funds.\n\nFounders who won't quit their job before they raise money often get stuck in a catch-22. They are waiting for an\ninvestor to take a bet on them before they quit their job. But the investors are waiting for the founders to believe\nenough in their own company to quit their job\\!\n\n*What I recommend*\n\nThe ideal situation is that two or more people from the lab who did the work leave together to start the company as\ncofounders. One full-time founder is also ok. One of the people who leave to start the company should be the CEO.\n\nIn many cases, other people who were involved in the research want to remain behind at the university but still\ncontribute in some way. That’s fine. Those are often called “academic cofounders” or “scientific cofounders” and they\ncan still be very helpful. But the founders who are going to be full-time are the most important.\n\n## Deciding when to spin out\n\nIn the early stages of developing a new technology, you’ll make faster progress still at the university, taking\nadvantage of university resources. It’s the ideal place to do the initial experiments to prove that your idea could\nwork. You can even do some testing of market demand for a new product, through programs like NSF I-Corps or just by\ncalling up potential customers/stakeholders. At some point, though, that will flip, and being at a university will start\nto slow you down, because universities are not set up to commercialize technologies.\n\nIt’s possible to leave too early and possible to wait too long before leaving. Unquestionably, though, the far more\ncommon mistake is to wait too long.\n\nMost founders wait too long because leaving is scary. Academia is a comforting environment. No one is pressuring you to\nleave and leaving seems risky so the natural thing to do is to keep delaying it. There's a temptation to make the\ntechnology perfect before spinning out, and there's always \"one more experiment\" you could do. If you don't stop this\ncycle, you'll never leave.\n\nOften after people do leave, they realize that a lot of the work they did in the last year was wasted, because some of\ntheir assumptions about what the market wanted were wrong. They also realize that they are now moving so much faster as\na company that they could have saved months of time by spinning out a year earlier.\n\n## Splitting up Equity\n\nAfter you've decided who is going to be full-time on the startup and what everyone's role will be, you'll want to split\nup equity.\n\nAs important as this decision is, founders often don't have a good framework for making it. Here is the framework I\nrecommend. It has just two rules<sup id=\"footnoteid1\"><a href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup>.\n\n1)  Founders who will be working on the company full-time should get equal or nearly equal amounts of equity.\n\n2)  Founders who will be leaving their job to work on the company full-time should get much more equity than founders\n    who are going to remain in academia. Academic cofounders should typically own no more than 10% unless they are going\n    to continue to be hands-on<sup id=\"footnoteid2\"><a href=\"#footnote2\">2</a></sup>.\n\nMy colleague Michael Seibel previously wrote a [great\nessay](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5x-how-to-split-equity-among-co-founders) about why rule \\#1 is so important.\nRule \\#2 is important because it is the full-time founders who will invest years of their life exclusively in making the\ncompany successful, and they need to have enough ownership that it makes sense for them to do that.\n\nThe biggest conceptual mistake I see scientific founding teams make here is that they think the purpose of allocating\nequity is to reward past contributions, when actually it’s mainly to anticipate future ones.\n\nHere's a blunt fact about starting a company. If you are going to make a new company successful, you will probably have\nto work on it for 7-10 years post spin-out. That's a long time\\!\n\nIf you are just spinning out of a university now, you might feel like you're halfway done, but actually you are on\nmile 2 of a 26 mile marathon. The academic founders may have been instrumental in the first mile, but it is the\nfull-time founders who will be primarily taking you the other 25. The equity split between founders has to reflect the\nexpected contributions over the whole marathon.\n\nOne consequence of this is that your equity split in the new company will not necessarily have any relation to your\nseniority within the original academic team. It’s often the case that the people leaving are more junior, while the\nsenior people / faculty remain. In that case, the founders who leave will end up with much more equity than their former\nboss. This can be an awkward conversation, but it’s entirely sensible.\n\n## Negotiating with tech transfer offices\n\nIf you are going to commercialize research started at a university, you will probably need to negotiate the rights to\nthe intellectual property. The group at a university that does that is the technology transfer\noffice.<sup id=\"footnoteid3\"><a href=\"#footnote3\">3</a></sup>\n\nIn the past, tech transfer offices had a well-deserved bad reputation. They were known for being slow and bureaucratic,\nand for forcing onerous terms onto fragile young startups. Many times the terms they insisted on strangled the very\ncompanies they were trying to create. There was so little transparency in the industry, it was hard for founders to know\nwhat terms were fair.\n\nFortunately, things have gotten better. There is now much more information available for founders. Tech transfer groups\nat the universities in major startup hubs like Harvard, MIT and Stanford now give startups reasonable terms (though they\nstill take too long to do it). At universities that have not seen many successful spin-outs, it's hit-or-miss. A few\nuniversities are now using “[express](https://ctl.cornell.edu/entrepreneurs/fasttrack/) [license\nagreements](https://techtransfercentral.com/2013/10/28/how-five-ttos-are-using-express-licenses-successfully/)”, preset\nagreements that require little to no negotiation; hopefully this will become more common.\n\nThere are typically four key terms<sup id=\"footnoteid4\"><a href=\"#footnote4\">4</a></sup> in these agreements.\n\n1)  Equity. Typically the university will get equity in the company. This is ok as long as it is not too much. 3-5% is\n    typical. Above 10% will cause problems.<sup id=\"footnoteid5\"><a href=\"#footnote5\">5</a></sup>,\n    <sup id=\"footnoteid6\"><a href=\"#footnote6\">6</a></sup>\n\n2)  Royalty. This means that you pay a percentage of revenue or profits to the university. If this is too high, it can\n    affect the viability of the company to raise money and operate. Ideally you would make this zero. If you can't do\n    that, try to keep it \\< 5%, and to have it terminate after a certain number of years and/or a certain level of\n    payments.\n\n3)  Milestone payments. I.e., \"You owe us $250K when the company raises its first $10M\", or “You owe us $500K when you\n    reach Phase II clinical trials”. Because cash is scarce in the early days of a startup, you want to keep these as\n    low as possible. You should never need to spend more than a few percent of the money you raise.\n\n4)  Exclusivity. If a license is not exclusive, the university could theoretically turn around and license the same IP\n    to a big company to go compete with you. This sounds like a real problem, but often it’s not. For many inventions,\n    in practice other companies won’t know how to use the IP and won’t value it until you've done years of work further\n    developing it (at which point the university-owned IP isn’t\n    sufficient).<sup id=\"footnoteid7\"><a href=\"#footnote7\">7</a></sup> It may be optimal to have a non-exclusive license\n    initially with an option to make it exclusive later, or a right of first refusal clause.  \n    Here is some advice for negotiating these agreements.\n\nYou should get in touch with founders of other companies that have recently negotiated agreements with the same office.\nFind out what terms they got and ask for advice on negotiating strategy. You can also ask investors, lawyers, and\nadvisors. You should get as many data points as possible.\n\nIf you’re a student or post doc, it’s valuable to have the buy-in of the professor running your lab. Professors have\nsway at universities and will give you leverage over a stubborn tech transfer office. You also want to make sure that\nthey don’t have any competing plans to do their own spin-out with the technology. Often by getting them onboard as an\nadvisor early, they will be helpful in securing a good deal, and they’ll also give you credibility with investors.\n\nIf the agreement feels too onerous, ask yourself if you need it at all. It might be cheaper to recreate something\nsimilar on the company’s time.<sup id=\"footnoteid8\"><a href=\"#footnote8\">8</a></sup>\n\nMore dramatically, you might end up not even using what you’re planning to license, because startups pivot all the time.\nI’ve worked with many companies that fought tooth and nail over their tech transfer agreement, only to find that a year\nlater they'd totally changed their approach and abandoned the IP they fought so hard to license\\! One way to protect\nagainst this is to ensure that any royalties are directly tied to the use of the technology.\n\nConsider taking an option to license the IP in the future, rather than negotiating a full license agreement now. An\noption is often much cheaper and simpler to get, and allows you to defer the final negotiation for six to twelve months.\nThat also gives you time to see how much you are using the original IP before committing to licensing it.\n\nBeware of well-meaning but bad advice from university entrepreneurship offices. Some entrepreneurship offices at\nuniversities are great, but unfortunately some are not. Worse, some have their own agendas, like helping local\ninvestors. Consider whether the people you’re talking to have a track record of many truly successful companies when\nlistening to their advice.\n\nStart the conversation with this office as early as possible. This will give you more time to work out an agreement and\nalso let you find out the lay of the land.\n\nDon't wait for the agreement to start the company. Getting an agreement can take 6 months or longer. Many investors\n(including YC) will fund companies before they have an agreement in place. The more progress you make on the company,\nthe more leverage you have in the negotiation.\n\n## After the spinout\n\nYou’ll need to incorporate your company. If you are based in the US (and possibly even if you aren’t), you’ll want to\nincorporate as a Delaware C Corporation, no matter which state you are physically\nin.<sup id=\"footnoteid9\"><a href=\"#footnote9\">9</a></sup>\n\nIt may well make sense to continue collaborating with your lab. They may produce new work which you want to license.\n\nIn some cases, you may want to continue doing experimental work using university labs. University core facilities are\ncommonly available to companies, albeit for higher fees. It’s possible to save a lot of money using university resources\ninstead of buying equivalents commercially. That’s fine, as long as it isn’t slowing you down significantly and doesn’t\ncreate IP issues. Unfortunately there is often a tradeoff between speed and cost.\n\nA big adjustment for founders from academia is internalizing a different incentive structure. In academia, you’re\nrewarded for new discoveries and for publications. In startups, there is zero reward for new discoveries and hardly any\nfor publications. In startups, the only thing that you are rewarded for is making tangible progress towards a\ncommercially valuable product.\n\nA side effect is that in startups, there is no intrinsic reward for doing something new or difficult. Any time there is\na shortcut where you can copy or buy something that already exists, you should take it. In startups, you want the “new\npart” of what you are doing to be as small as possible, and everything else to be as boring and low risk as possible.\n\nAnother big adjustment is the pace. In startups, you are racing against the clock. If you don’t hit milestones before\nyour current funding runs out, your company will run out of money and die. That kind of hard constraint forces focus\nlike nothing else. As a result, founders who leave academia to do YC often tell us they got more done in the three month\nYC batch than the prior year.\n\nIf that’s made startups sound stressful, they are, if only because so much is at stake. When you’re starting your own\ncompany, the highs are higher and the lows are lower than any regular job. If you want to learn more about what it feels\nlike, there’s a great essay called “[What Startups Are Really Like](http://paulgraham.com/really.html)”.\n\nThere has [never been a better time](https://blog.samaltman.com/hard-startups) to start a biotech or hard-tech company.\nThere is [far more funding available](#footnoteid9) now than ever before, and a well developed ecosystem to support\nfounders at every stage. Today most grad students and postdocs choose between staying in academia and getting a job in\nindustry. We think there will increasingly be a third option: to start their own company.\n\n**Thanks**  \nI couldn’t have written this without the help of many YC founders who did spin-outs themselves. Special thanks to Uri\nLopatin, Birgitt Boschitsch, Aaron Lazarus, Alexis Rovner, Juan Medina, Glenn Markov, John Ramunas, Wesley Wiersen,\nLindsay Amos, Ravi Pamnani, and Andrew Jajack for reading drafts of this.\n\n## Notes\n\n<b id=\"footnote1\">1.</b> Separately, it’s also very important for all founders to have a [vesting\nschedule](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/equity) for their shares. It should vest over at least four\nyears.[↩](#footnoteid1)  \n<b id=\"footnote2\">2.</b> Being “hands-on” means more than giving advice.
