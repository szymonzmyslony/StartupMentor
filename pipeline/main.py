            "The hopelessly question\nbegging advice that if\nyou're interested in\ngenuinely interesting\nproblems, gratifying your\ninterest energetically is\nthe best way to prepare\nyourself for a start-up.\nAnd, for that matter,\nprobably the best way to\nlive.\nBut although I can't explain\nin\nthe general case what counts\nas an interesting problem,\nI can tell you about a large\nsubset of them.\nIf you think of technology\nas something\nthat's spreading like a sort\nof fractal stain,\nevery point on the edge\nthat's moving,\nrepresents an interesting\nproblem.\nSteam engines is not so\nmuch, although maybe, you\nnever know.\nSo, one guaranteed way to\nturn your mind into the type\nthat startup ideas form in\nunconsciously is to\nget yourself to the leading\nedge of some technology, to,\nas Paul Buchheit put it,\nlive in the future.\nAnd when you get there,\nideas that seem uncannily\nprescient to some people\nwill seem obvious to you.\nYou may not realize they're\nstartup ideas, but you'll\nknow they're something that\nought to exist.\nFor example, back at\nHarvard,\nback in the mid 90s,\na fellow grad student of my\nfriends Robert and\nTrevor, wrote his own\nvoiceover IP software.\nIt wasn't meant to be a\nstartup.\nHe never tried to turn it\ninto one.\nHe just wanted to talk to\nhis girlfriend in\nTaiwan without paying for\nlong distance calls.\nAnd since he was an expert\non networks,\nit seemed obvious to him\nthat the thing to do was to\nturn the sound into packets\nand\nship them over the Internet\nfor free.\nWhy didn't everybody do\nthis?\nWell because they weren't\ngood at writing that kind\nof software.\nHe never did anything with\nthis.\nHe never tried to turn it\ninto a startup.\nBut that is how all the best\nstartups tend to happen.\nSo, strangely enough, the\noptimal thing to do in\ncollege if you wanna be a\nsuccessful startup founder,\nis not some sort of new\nvocational version of\ncollege focused on\nentrepreneurship.\nIt’s the classic version of\ncollege as education for\nits own sake.\nIf you wanna start a\nstartup, what you\nshould do in college is\nlearn powerful things.\nAnd if you have genuine\nintellectual curiosity,\nthat's what you'll naturally\ntend to\ndo if you just follow your\nown inclinations.\nThe component of\nentrepreneurship,\nI can never quite say that\nword with a straight face,\nthat really matters is\ndomain expertise.\nLarry Page is Larry Page cuz\nhe was an expert on search.\nAnd the way he became an\nexpert on search,\nwas because he was genuinely\ninterested in it,\nnot because of some ulterior\nmotive.\nAt its best,\nstarting a startup is merely\nan ulterior motive for\ncuriosity and you'll do it\nbest if you introduce\nthe ulterior motive at the\nend of the process.\nSo here, is the ultimate\nadvice for young would-be\nstartup founders reduced to\ntwo words, just learn.\nAll right, how much time do\nwe have left?\n18 minutes.\n18 minutes of questions,\ngood god,\ndo you guys have the\nquestions?\nSure, we’ll start with,\ntwo questions online or\nwe can start with others.\nYou guys are in charge,\nwhatever you wanna do.\nOkay.",
