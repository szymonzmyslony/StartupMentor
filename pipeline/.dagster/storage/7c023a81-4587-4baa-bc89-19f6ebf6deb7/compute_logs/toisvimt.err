Because YC invests in startups so early, I've spent a lot of time with people who aren't yet sure if they should start a company or not. I've helped many people, including my own friends and family, think about this decision and my intended audience for this talk is anyone who doesn't feel ready to start a startup today, but thinks they may want to one day in the future.

I'm gonna break down the topic of whether you should start a startup into two parts. First, we'll talk about which types of people seem best suited to being startup founders and help you figure out if you might be one of them. Second, we'll talk about how you might best prepare yourself for becoming a startup founder in the future.

Let's start by helping you figure out if you are the kind of person who should become a startup founder or not. I really wish there were a simple test you could take that would give you a clear and correct answer to that question. I've now worked with almost a thousand startup founders as a group partner at YC, and I still get surprised by which people take to startup life like a duck to water and which ones struggle to adapt. Now, you might find this surprising if your image of startups is based on the way famous founders are often depicted in books or movies. These depictions can make it seem that if you're not a ruthless, brilliant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network movie, or a charismatic product genius like Steve Jobs in one of the many books or movies about him, you probably aren't cut out to be a startup founder.
Now, I can't deny that being a brilliant programmer or a charismatic product genius will certainly make it easier to be a successful startup founder. But I can say that after working with many successful founders, there are many more different types of people who succeed at startups with different strengths than just those stereotypes.

As an investor, my job is to pick which people will make great startup founders. And yet, even after 15 years of starting and investing in startups, I still get surprised by who turns out to be a great startup founder. That means it's gonna be hard for you to know for sure if you are suited to being one. You might think you could just look at how well someone has done in school or at work and assume success there will lead to success at startups. That's definitely what I thought when I first started working at YC in 2010 and began reading YC funding applications for the first time. After I started working with more startups, though, I realized that these signals mattered much less than I'd expected they would.

When you're working on a startup, you have to put in blood, sweat, and tears to convince even a single user to care about trying your product, let alone convincing the first 10 or a hundred. You have to push through a lot of rejection to get there, and because this is your startup all of that rejection feels very personal in a way it doesn't, when you're working at a fan company, building a product for someone else. It takes a lot of resilience to make it through this initial struggle to get your early users, and that's the quality I think is most important for startup founders to have. 

Resilient people are suited to startups and should definitely become founders, but how do you know if you have enough resilience to be a startup founder? When I first started working at YC, I thought I could use confidence as a proxy for resilience. I'd assume that if someone projected confidence, like speaking with conviction, being high energy during our funding interviews, they were likely to be a resilient founder. The more founders I worked with though, the more I realized this was also wrong. It turned out that someone could appear very confident initially, but not be resilient when their startup hit roadblocks. Conversely, some of the quietest and least confident seeming founders at first turned out to be the most resilient founders I'd go on to work with, many, eventually taking their companies public.

This is Sajith, the founder of Benchling. I met him when we funded Benchling in 2012. Benchling is now worth over $6 billion, and Sajith has grown into a formidable founder and CEO. But I remember when we first interviewed him and his co-founder Cory. They were both softly spoken engineers and we were all concerned they wouldn't be suited to working on Benchling because Benchling's idea was to sell software to biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies to make money, and we weren't sure that they would be good at that kind of enterprise sales. This concern was shared by investors at demo day, who worried that they wouldn't be able to get those biotech or pharmaceutical companies to pay for the Benchling software. And Benchling struggled to raise very much seed funding at demo day. Sales did turn out to be a real struggle for Benchling. In fact, over a year after they'd graduated from YC, Benchling was still not making any revenue, though they did have some enthusiastic grad students as free users, and the product continued getting better. It took them almost another year - that's now two years after YC - to start doing sales and making any revenue. Now, Benchling is on course to become a public company someday and has many of the world's top biotech and pharmaceutical companies as customers. Looking back, I always had confidence that Sajith was a good engineer. But I could not have predicted back when we funded him in 2012, that he would have the resilience to overcome that amount of rejection and transform himself into the leader of a company that took many years to become great at enterprise sales.

But what I haven't shared with you are the stories of many other founders who seemed equally talented at first when we first funded their companies, but turned out not to have the same amount of resilience as these founders did. I've thought a lot about how to tell the difference between people who have this kind of startup resilience and those who don't.

I've wondered if maybe having the right motivations or reasons to start a company mean you're more likely to have this special resilience. Over time, though, I've decided that this also doesn't matter as much as I had thought. I think there are many perfectly legitimate motivations to start a company.

For example, it's become popular to say that you shouldn't start a company just to make money. That's considered a somewhat flimsy motivation, but I actually think it's fine to start a startup to become rich. Startups are one of the few ways to make life changing amounts of money in a relatively short period of time.

If the desire to make money gets you started, then great. Go for it. I also think that simply being curious about what it's like to found a startup is a fine initial motivation to start one. Actually doing a startup is the only way to know for sure if you'll enjoy it. The reason I have conviction that your initial motivations don't matter so much is that I've seen motivations change over time.

I've seen founders who started out a company with a plan to sell it within a year changed their mind as they kept working with the company and are still working on that same startup a decade later, and it's now a public company. This means that your initial motivations to start a startup aren't as important as what those motivations might change into over time. In order to keep working on a startup and keep going through those dark periods that every startup experiences, you need enduring motivations, and I think the best ones are to be genuinely interested in the problem you're working on and love the people you're working with. We'll talk more about finding those later.

So instead of introspecting too much on, if you'll make a good startup founder, I'll offer some practical advice. If you are curious about what it'd be like to start a company, start by asking yourself, What do I have to lose? Now, I mean this question, not as a rhetorical one, but as a very practical one. Figure out what the worst case scenario looks like if you started a startup and decide if you can live with that. It's probably gonna take at least a year for you to have enough data to tell if the startup you're working on is promising enough to keep working on. In the worst case, you'll shut down the company without having earned much or any salary for that year. Can you live with that worst case? The calculus here is different for everyone. If you're about to graduate college, taking a year after graduating to work on a startup is not a big deal. Those job offers will still be waiting for you in a year, but if you've been a FAANG employee for the past nine years and you're in line for a big promotion this year, then maybe you stand to lose a lot by spending the next year working on a startup instead. Asking yourself if you can handle the worst case is the best way to know if you should start a startup. Be honest with yourself. If you can't actually handle the worst case, then your own constant anxiety will probably self-sabotage your startup efforts. 

When you're thinking about the worst case scenario of working on a startup, you should factor something else into the equation. You will learn a lot from starting a company. I don't think enough people factor in how valuable this learning is when they're doing their worst case scenario analysis. As a startup founder, you are responsible for making everything happen, and that means you get to do lots of different types of work. You'll have to do some amount of sales, product and customer support all at once. This can be very clarifying in helping you figure out what type of work you enjoy and where you might want to focus your career, even if the startup doesn't work out. Some people start a company that doesn't work, and then they jump straight back into starting another one because they wanna learn from their mistakes. Others decide they actually really enjoy specializing in doing one thing really well, and they join a company where they can do just that. The startup experience can really improve your career opportunities, even if the startup doesn't succeed. 

My second startup, Triplebyte, used software to help companies identify and hire great people. I work with hundreds of employers as they search for the best talent, and I found that many of them were explicitly looking to hire people who had previous startup experience. They believed they showed evidence of being a self-starter and being able to take initiative and lead projects. Some of the most successful YC companies have actually built their hiring processes around this knowledge.

Rippling a $10 billion company founded by Parker Conrad, also a YC company, hires former founders and puts them in charge of entire product divisions. "Usually we love hiring former founders to run specific product lines and, and build them and, and really run them as general managers. We've been, you know, really successful at recruiting. I think we have now probably around 50 former founders that work at Rippling." At YC, we often see startup founders leave their startup if it doesn't work out and go on to join a more successful YC company. 

This is Nick Grandy. YC funded his first startup Wundrbar in 2008. That startup shut down, but he went on to join another YC company you may have heard of, Airbnb, as its first employee. That, of course, worked out great. After many years at Airbnb, he left to start another YC company, Outschool, which is now valued at over $3 billion. 

I share these stories to show how career progressions are not always perfectly linear. Introducing some serendipity and meeting smart, ambitious people can completely transform your career, and being a startup founder is a great way to do exactly that.


Okay, so let's say you do decide you can live with the worst case of doing a startup, but you're not ready to do one right now. How can you best prepare yourself to start one in the future? To actually start a company you'll want two things, an idea and a co-founder. Now, sometimes an idea and co-founder both come to you quickly and you're off to the races.


There's lots of great startup content out there about how to start a company once you're ready, but let's talk about what to do if it'll take you some time to get to that point. I'd start by encouraging you to not think of finding ideas and co-founders as two separate tasks. It's hard to think up good ideas yourself. Also, your ideas will start out being vague and fuzzy, more like a hunch or an impulse than a clearly formed idea, and you'll go through seven iterations of fleshing it out into something more tangible and concrete. Having someone to talk through that initial idea or impulse with and debate and discuss is important, and the best person to do that with is your co-founder. I find my best ideas come to me during conversations with smart people, so I'd start by thinking about who do you know that you enjoy talking about ideas with? In college, these are often the people you'll go to when you're stuck on a hard problem, or they're the people you most enjoy working on group assignments with. At work, these are the colleagues who you find make you the most productive and help you do your best work. I'd seek these people out and start having conversations with them about ideas or technologies that you find interesting. Talk about products you use every day that you admire or are frustrated by. Talk about technologies you think are underrated today and why.
Flesh your thoughts out and debate them. Spend the time between these conversations, doing your own reading and research to learn more about the topics you find interesting. If you're a curious person, this will seem natural to you anyway. All of this primes your mind to more easily notice and think of potential startup ideas, and it helps you get to know your friends or colleagues better as potential co-founders.
If you are struggling to think of people you enjoy talking about ideas with, then you probably need to change your environment and meet some new people. If you really wanna start a company one day, it's best to choose an environment where you'll be around many people who might someday be your co-founder.
I think the best environment for this is working at a startup. You both get to see how a startup works from the inside, and your colleagues will be less risk averse than the average FAANG employee. 

So, if you're in college, I'd recommend finding a startup to work at after graduation, or if you're at a FAANG company now, think about leaving to join a startup as an intermediate step to starting your own someday.
Once you're around smart people who you enjoy talking about ideas with, I'd recommend you start experimenting with turning these ideas into side projects. At some point during these conversations, you'll eventually say something like,' Huh, like, it'd be cool if someone built X', and that's the moment to stop and think about how you could be the one to build X. Is there a simple first version you could build over a weekend? Or can you find other people who might be users and pitch them on the idea to see how they react? Keep pulling on this thread until you've come up with a plan to turn this idea into something real, however small it is. Right now, you're not trying to launch the next unicorn. You're just getting used to the experience of turning ideas into reality and experiencing the thrill of launching something. 

To turn your idea into something real, you'll need the skills to actually build them. If you're not a programmer, then either you'll need to learn how to program or find a co-founder who is a programmer. My advice, speaking from experience as someone who started his first startup without being able to code, is start learning to code. You only need to learn enough to build a version one of your ideas. 

Once you're around smart people, and you're working on some side projects, how do you know when it's time to take the leap and quit your job to start a company? While it'd be great if one of your side projects started getting explosive traction and made the decision easy for you, you can't rely on that happening if you're serious about starting a company someday. Even if you launch your side projects and get some early users, the feedback you get will be mixed. It's not uncommon for the early users of any product to span the spectrum of being delighted, appalled, and indifferent towards a product. To judge how promising your side project is as a startup idea, I'd use some advice from my Y Combinator partner, Paul Buchheit. He says that it's better to make a product that a few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards. If your side project elicits a deep reaction from someone, the kind where they can legitimately say that doing something very differently as a result of your product existing, then you may be onto something. A single passionate user of a crude prototype that was hacked together on a weekend means so much more than a million signups on a wait list for something that doesn't exist yet. 

My main advice to you would be to think less about how well your side projects are going, and think more about how much you're enjoying the process of thinking up ideas and turning them into something real.
Are you learning new things and finding yourself energized? Contrast this feeling with your day job. If you find your job is draining, but you have energy to work on your side projects on evenings and weekends, that's a sign it may be time to quit and work on your own ideas. Pay particular attention to how much you enjoy working with your side project collaborators. If you enjoy working with them and you both want to be startup founders, recognize how rare that is. Having a great co-founder who wants to do a startup is a fantastic reason to quit and start one. To finish, my advice is: one, don't worry too much about your initial motivations or reasons to start a company. Those can change over time. Simply being curious about the experience of starting a startup is enough to get going. Think about the worst case scenario if you did start a company and be sure you can live with that. If you don't yet have an idea or co-founder, start looking around for smart people to talk about ideas with and launch some side projects with. Actually launch those side projects, however small, to get the experience of turning ideas into reality.

And if you find someone you really enjoy working on side projects with and you both want to start a company, make the jump. I really hope you do, and I hope we get to work together at Y Combinator someday. Thanks so much.

And the thing to know about both of these talks is we've been talking about them from the point of view of the investor. Basically, it was helpful, I thought, to explain to founders how investors evaluate startup ideas and looking at that structure so that they can better understand their own ideas, opportunities, and then in this presentation, present them better to the people that they want to get excited.

So, a quick recap. In the first part, I basically say a startup idea is a hypothesis for why your company is gonna grow really quickly. That hypothesis must compose of three different parts: the problem, the solution, and insight. And the basic parts is your problem should be pretty big, pretty pervasive, have a lot of these characteristics to make it feel like there's a very big market that a lot people have the problem. Don't think you need to know about the solution is that you should not start with a technology, you should start with a problem. And lastly, you're looking to have something that's gonna make your company unique and have some kind of unfair advantage that we call an insight that will show why your company will grow faster than other companies.

I talked about five different types of unfair advantages that your company can have, and kind of what are the benchmarks for meeting them. Now, the thing to keep in mind about understanding and creating this startup idea is that I don't need you to do all the work that lay all of that out in detail. That stuff that you'll kind of want to know or keep in mind, but a really good investor will do that on their own. They'll hear what you're talking about and extrapolate.

And so, what I'm gonna cover in this presentation is how do you package up that hypothesis? How do you take all the things that you understand about your company and your startup idea, and how you present it to an investor so that they can make a decision that's in your favor? This is the YC startup application. And basically, this is the application, all the questions that we ask that YC partners will use to evaluate your startup.

So, down here, when you're filling out the YC application, we actually linked to a couple of things and one of them is How to Apply Successfully. I can't tell because I've read so many applications, but it feels like founders are not reading that essay. It was written by Paul Graham in 2009 and almost everything in there still holds to this day, and people still make mistakes on it. So, I'm just gonna like, point out some stuff and really, like, punch it in here while I have your attention.

So, here's a quote from that essay. Basically, we believe for every company that we will interview at YC, we bet there's probably another company that's just as good to them out there but they messed up on the application and we didn't realize it. We didn't invite them. And basically, the reason is because they didn't express their idea clearly. That's it. Like, you might think, "Oh, I didn't show off all that complex stuff about my startup idea and that's why they didn't pick me." And I want you to know, that's not true. And so, the first thing I want you to keep in mind is I do not need you to sell me as a YC partner. Right?

So, average investor, what they do is they talk to you when you tell them about your idea, and it feels like they're poking holes, all the questions they ask about what's all the reasons why this could go wrong? A good investor does it the other way around. They hear what you say and they imagine and they use their optimism and they use knowing that some kind of rare event has to happen for you to become a billion-dollar company and they try to imagine all the those rare events that could possibly happen to you, and then they pitch that path back to you.

And so, we are really good at selling ourselves. So, you don't need to do that. And the thing is, you guys are kind of bad at selling things in the beginning, right? And what I need you to understand is that I'm trying to evaluate these three statements when I'm hearing your idea. Do I understand it? Am I excited by it? Do I like the team and do I wanna work with them?

Surprise, in your weekly updates, when you do your group sessions, these are the questions that we ask you to ask one another. It's basically the questions that we're trying to figure out for ourselves. And we're hoping that every week, when you talk with other companies, you are practicing getting feedback and understanding whether you're able to instill this in other people. So, your goal is just to be clear, I will do everything else.

So, back to the application. These are the only two things we're gonna focus on today. What do I put in the what's my company going to make? How do I describe my company in a very efficient manner? The first way to do this is to be clear. The reason we focus on this is because a clear idea is a foundation for growth.

And what I mean by that is that the best companies in YC, or around the world, grow organically, they grow by word of mouth. What does word of mouth look like? It looks like this. It's basically, I talk about your company, what you're doing, making, etc. and I'm the most interesting person at the dinner table. And I tell it to other people, and those people wanna tell other people. That's it. Word of mouth is something where I remember what you do, I talk about it enthusiastic, and it spreads on its own. Marketing and advertising, it's a tax I believe companies pay because they did not make something remarkable.

Now, before anyone can remember at the dinner table what you do, they have to understand. And so, I have very simple rules for how to make things easy to understand. This will sound familiar if you're familiar with an essay I wrote on "How to Design a Better Pitch Deck." And I'm gonna focus on basically saying that the way I talk about designing a pitch deck actually works for ideas and lots of other things. And so, the way I make things easy to understand on a pitch deck or a slide is to make it legible, to make it simple, and make it obvious.

In today's presentation, we're just gonna focus on making your idea legible. It's gonna sound interesting, right? For clarity. Now, in my essay, I talked about how at demo day, when our startups are presenting to a roomful of 1,000 investors, it's kind of an interesting audience. Number one, the audience is filled with really old people, they tend to not have very good eyesight as a result, they all can't sit in the front row like you lovely people. Some of them have to sit in a way back and stand up. And that means if you create a legible slide, they have to be ones that even old people in the back row with bad eyesight can read.

Now, how does that apply to a legible idea? Well, basically, you are designing a slide that democratizes the idea, right? And so people who are blind or people who are ignorant, you're basically designing something for everyone in the room, not just the ones in the first row. So, a legible idea can be understood by people who know nothing about your business. That will make things very clear to the widest possible audience. Now, this is super important because you will talk about your company more than anything else. It is actually the thing that we are really great at Y Combinator. We have our companies constantly practice talking about their startup.

Startup School curriculum is designed around helping you constantly practice talking about your startup. And this is because you are going to need a lot of people if you're going to become a billion-dollar company. So, you are trying to find a co-founder, you have to have a way of talking about your company clearly. Whether you're getting users, or investors, or employees, or shareholders, you have to get really good at this. And you have to be able to do it quickly and efficiently.

Here are things to avoid that makes things not clear, that makes your idea muddy. The first is ambiguity, right? So, that's like, obviously, the opposite of clear or straightforward. Something's a little abstract, something could be interpreted in two ways. And therefore, it might take a question to understand what you do.

Complexity. So, I've a very specific definition of complexity. And so, if you look at the root word, simple and complex come from the same root and having to do with twists or braids. Things that are simple are ones that have one braid and things that are complex have multiple braids. They're intertwined with one another. A simple idea is one idea that does not fold. A complex idea are ideas that are intertwined. So, simplicity means you are not trying to mix a bunch of things in your description.

Mystery. So, this is an odd one. Well, what I mean is anything where it's like, I'm not gonna understand what is going on when you're talking about your company. Jargon is one, obviously, any words that I don't understand, anything that's fake like indefinite pronouns. So, if you just use this, etc., and you don't describe what those nouns are, and then things that you just suggest, but aren't explicit about.

And the last is ignorable. And so, what I mean by that is there's some language that we will just ignore. So, in UX design, people will create a sort of blindness to things that they don't wanna look at or they don't find to be of important value. So, for example, ad blindness is a big one that people sort of understand. And the thing is, when you're talking about ideas, there's a way of using language that is also easily ignorable, things that just won't stick in your head.

Things like marketing speak. It's probably lots of stuff that you heard about that, MBA speak, where you kind of like, puff yourself up, talk that doesn't give any extra information, and then buzzwords. And so, when you say certain types of words, that as an investor I've heard over and over again or I will equate with zero information or value, then I will ignore them. And the result is parts of your pitch will end up being not even heard by me, and therefore I will not remember them.

What you wanna do is be conversational. A great pitch is one where you can tell it to your mom and she gets it. She's proud of you, right? She's not gonna shake her head. And that means it's got to be conversational. And that's really good for word of mouth because we talk in normal conversational speak. We don't talk like an MBA. We don't talk like CEOs all the time. So, it's best to talk conversationally.

Again, avoid jargon, words that are only understood or used by your industry. No preamble. We'll have some examples of this. But if you wanna be clear, let's go straight to what you want to talk about. Let's not have a winding path to eventually getting there.

And the last one, this one's a big one, it's being reproducible. So, when I hear your idea, can I imagine it in my mind? Can I see what I would have to build to create your company? If I don't have that, then I have no picture in my head about what your company does. And until I have that picture, I can't ask any of the questions that helps me understand, if I'm excited about you or understand other nuances of your business. To make things reproducible, I need to know nouns. I need to have objects that I'm gonna imagine in my head.

And there's three types of nouns that I should understand from your startup idea. First one is what are you making? That should be really clear. What is the problem? And then who is the customer? The two are kind of related to the market, right? But I should have these kind of three nouns in my head.

So, let's go through some examples. This says, we are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information. This sucks. The thing is, we see this all the time. Number one, all the nouns that you see down here are abstract. They're ideas. I can't reproduce based off of this, has zero informational value. I still have to ask questions to answer the three nouns that I need to have. This is a bad description for a company.

We will see stuff that starts like this, when we ask, "Describe what your company is gonna make." I don't even wanna read it. But basically, it starts talking about the story of the company. Or basically, like, "In the beginning, there was this problem, and we're gonna go through this issue, right? And then there's these bad guys, and they showed up, but then who's gonna save us? We're finally here to save..." And you're like, "I have to read another thousand applications." That's not gonna work for me.

This is the description on the actual application that Airbnb put to YC. Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, instead of hotels. It's concise, it's descriptive. I understand what they're building, I have a sense for what they're making. And then I can start thinking about my other two ideas of whether I'm excited about it. And then am I gonna like this team?

Here's Dropbox. Synchronizes files across your or your team's computers. The thing about this is it's refreshing but also there's no pretense. They aren't playing defense. I see a lot of company descriptions where they're like, "I'm worried about this, or I've gotten this kind of feedback." And so, they give up clarity to make themselves look bigger and blow themselves up or make themselves try to look more interesting. They're trying to protect themselves against something way ahead of time. And the whole problem is usually what ends up doing is it brings me farther away from you, all that padding that you've put on yourself.

Here's a description from a company in the current batch. Lumineye is building X-ray vision for soldiers and first responders. We don't have to go deep into the details. I don't need to understand how they exactly do this, etc. This creates a foundation for my curiosity. Now, I will start from here to try to figure out, "Oh, how do you do this? Is this the right team to do this? How far along are they? Do they have traction? Do they have customers?" I start going down the route of asking all the right questions based off this one description. This is a good one.

There's another one. So, Vahan, in the current batch, is building LinkedIn for the next billion internet users. So, doesn't perfectly connect me to what they're sort of making, but I'm intrigued. I'm excited about someone building the LinkedIn and I know it's some kind of social network for business people. And so, now I'm curious about how. I don't need you to answer how in the description, but I understand what you're doing. And then, now, I can start making questions in my head about like, how would I evaluate whether this is working or successful or promising or not? Or is this the right team? Do they have a certain amount of traction, etc.? It gets me on the right track.

Now, the reason I've used this example is because we have a lot of companies who try to use the X for Y. And what I mean by that is like LinkedIn for whatever or Uber for blank or Airbnb for blank. And so, that X for Y is super useful because it allows you to shortcut business model and some kind of complex behavior, right? And then attach it to some other vertical or something that you're trying to make work. X for Y is okay but most people abuse it or do it incorrectly. So, I'm gonna give you some tips.

First, should you use X for Y? Sorry for the legibility. Number one, is X a household name? This should be like a billion-dollar company, right? You can't use your uncle's like pet shoe store as the X for this because people don't know your uncle's pet shoe store and they don't know if it's successful or not, right? So, everyone, as many people should know about this as possible, and for an investor, it should be clear that it's a billion-dollar-company opportunity. Everyone has to agree that it is successful. So, you could have a really big X everyone knows about it but it's infamous, right? So, a lot of people don't think it's successful. So, be careful of that.

Does Y want X? So, is it really clear why the target that you're going after wants this kind of model applied to it, this kind of solution applied to it? Whether it's Airbnb for, Airbnb, or Uber for, etc. It should be really clear that that's a segment that's either missing it, it's not being served well by the other one, and also that those people want to have that kind of model.

And then third one is Y should be a huge market? So, if you're building X for Y and in the last part doesn't sound like a really big business, that's not gonna work well for you, right? Because what we want, because you're essentially saying that you are something but it's a subset. And what we want to make sure is that subset feels like it could be really, really big. If you choose the subset that sounds like it's going to be really, really small, investors won't be as interested. It means that I'm worried that you will not have enough potential headroom to grow to become a billion-dollar company.

So, here's an example that it doesn't work. So, we had a company in the batch that started off by describing themselves as Buffer for Snapchat. Buffer is a nice company, but definitely smaller than Snapchat. So, don't wanna do that.

All right, so basic summary for this section. Lead with what not why or how. You don't need all that other stuff, that stuff gets in the way of your clarity for the most part. I read that like 1,000 applications every single batch and it's a really hard thing to do. Basically, even though it's my job, it's really, really difficult to have that much focus and attention across all these different applications. So, I need some empathy. I need you to help me out.

And what we want is that when I bring up your application, and I'm looking at it, let's make our intimate time really pleasurable, right? Let's make the time that I spend on your idea very efficient. I'll just look at it, I'll understand really clearly, I'll move around your application to be like, "Oh, I'm kind of excited, maybe there's gonna have this." And I'll look at that part and I'm like, "Oh, they do have it, that sounds awesome. Oh, what about this? Oh, that sounds awesome, too."

What we don't want is me to go like, "I don't know what they're talking about." Then I have to like, go to your website, I'm like, "I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know how that sort of works." I go back to it, I try to figure something else out, I try to see if like some other partner might understand what you're doing, etc. Super inefficient. Where is there going to be room for me to get excited as a result?

So, to be efficient, we need to be concise. Concise. The best way, I wanna keep this in mind, is to use some examples. And so, here's some things I need you to keep in mind. Yes, I want you to be concise, use as few words as possible. And what I want you to understand is the concision, it actually gives me secondary information about you as a team. It lets me one, know that you've thought deeply about your idea. Because you've thought so deeply about it and because you've practiced talking about it so much, and you've gotten really good at getting people excited and understand your thing really quickly, you probably figured out how to do it in a short amount of time. So, it lets me know that this is a founder that has thought deeply about the idea.

The other thing about being concise, it shows me that you are efficient. And if you're efficient with your words, then you're probably efficient with your thoughts, and that means you're probably also efficient with your actions. And what that means is that I will start to believe that you understand what is most important about your business, you understand and communicate it clearly. And you might actually know how to always figure out the most important part of what to do about your company to make it grow, to make it work, etc.

So, there's a minimum stuff that we want to have, even though we're trying to be as concise as possible. Again, I wanna understand the nouns. So, if we're so concise, that I can't understand these, then your concision is too much. The other is, I want to get to this point, when I read the concision or this short version of whatever it is you're talking about, because again, I know there's like 100,000 reasons why your company is great, but when I'm reading your application, I'm only going to maybe remember two to three of them. And so we have to try to make sure those most important ones come up to the top.

This is a real Startup School company description. It's an online ecommerce store. I can picture what it is, but again, it's not a description that helps me get excited about, it doesn't help me lead to all the other things. I have to do now more work to understand why this is fast growing and its potential. I also don't know, based on this, some nouns. I don't know exactly who the customer is. Is it people that are selling stuff too? Are they making an e commerce store for other shop owners? It's ambiguity.

IT security services. This is most of the descriptions that we see on Startup School. It makes it really, really hard for us to understand it.

A meritocratic decision support system. The thing is, I wanna know for what, for whom, I don't even understand what the problem is that they're solving based off of this. And so, is it because a lot of people have non... Basically, I have to ask so many questions in my head to figure out why did they get to this sort of description.

Learn and sharing knowledge about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Sounds more like a mission. I can't tell what the product is,
and how they're sorted and go about it. Like, I couldn't reproduce this. If I had 10 companies build based off this description, you'd have 10 very different products. The only thing that's odd about company descriptions is you guys tend to capitalize and make proper nouns very weird words and phrases. You should not do that. It's not like a magazine title. And it makes me think sometimes you're emphasizing the wrong things. Like you're thinking the data science and artificial intelligence is the thing that's gonna make me excited. And the thing is like, those are the buzzwords, those are the solutions, and it makes me worried that you haven't started with a problem.

Let's do an example of like how to adjust a description. So, here's a much longer one. So, our company will make low cost and low power consumption medical devices based on artificial intelligence and IoT suitable for sub-Saharan communities. Now, relatively clear, I could understand it reading it, but it's not the most concise form of this and I feel like there's a lot of things get in the way. And so, when I work with companies to help shrink and reduce and improve their descriptions so that I will get the most out of it. I wanna talk through the process.

The first thing I wanna do is figure out what are the nouns in the description? Here we go. Our company, medical devices, for sub-Saharan communities. Oh shit, we're almost done, right? Everything else that gets added on here, whatever verb, adjectives or adverbs you want, you wanna be really careful. You wanna know like, is it giving maximum punch for this? Right? And so, really, the verb is going to be usually just you're making something, etc.

But usually it's going to be whatever the product, like, the verb is like the thing that we're making. If we're thinking about this in an active voice structure, the subject, the verb, and then the object - the customer, the market, the people we're going after. Everything else, if we add anything back to this, I really wanna be really careful about why we're gonna add back to it. Is that gonna be the stuff that makes me excited?

So, the artificial intelligence, IoT suitable stuff, that's like how they wanna get to it, the technology, and I'm more worried that they're wanting to use buzzwords to describe it, right? Hopefully, that's like a secret weapon that you have. But I bet it's not the defining characteristics of whether this company is successful or not.

And then up here, I see two modifiers for medical devices, low cost, low power consumption. So, low cost, I could definitely see, that's super interesting. If you make a low-cost device in sub-Saharan community, then I'm like, "Oh, that's interest. That's really interesting." Because that's, like, it's hard just to make something, you know, for developing countries, but to make it so that actually affordable for them, that'd be interesting. The low power consumption, I can give or take there, I'd have to know more about the company to know whether that's actually crucial to understanding whether this company has an unfair advantage or not.

So, if I was to redo this, we come out to, "We create affordable medical devices for sub-Saharan Africa." Some people are gonna be very squeamish about this. A lot of founders are worried it's like, "You're putting me in a box, man. It's too reductive. My business is complex, I do a lot of things and a lot of things make me great. I wanna tell you all of them." And the thing is, like, you don't have time, and I know it, as an investor. There is no investor that thinks any business is like simple and easy. I just don't think that from the default, so you shouldn't be worried that I'm going to think something small of that.

And again, you wanna be careful of the defense on here. Once I get to this, then I'll start asking the other questions. It creates that foundation for curiosity.

All right, I'm pretty much here at the end. The best way to help me, and I would love for you to help me, is to be clear and concise. Thank you very much.

All right, so we'll do a couple of questions about this presentation. And then I'll have Adora join me and then we'll answer questions about anything. Right here.

Man 1: Thanks for the presentation, Kevin. You talked a lot about what is presenting an application but you also hear a lot of pitches, especially in demo day. And what, in your opinion, are the killer tips to make a great pitch and get people to like you in a demo day?

Kevin: So, he's asking about, like, I talked a lot about here about writing an idea for the application, how's that might be different for companies who are pitching or presenting investors on like a demo day? What are things that we look for? And so, I talked about in that essay that I wrote how to pitch, how to design a pitch deck and talk about like how to present the ideas. The main thing to keep in mind is that at...

So let me describe the situation. So, demo day at Y Combinator, it's like 1,000 people in the room, and you have two minutes to talk about your company and show what you've built to get them excited. And then there's gonna be 200 other companies that will do the same thing on the stage. It's an extremely hard problem. And so, in two minutes, what do you get across? How do we get it so that in two minutes, a company on average will then raise $1.5 million after demo day?

And the thing to keep in mind is that, yes, there's 100 reasons why your company is great. You cannot say all of them in two minutes, you can't say them in a short conversation when you're meeting a bunch of investors inside of the room. There's like maybe five to six points that are really, really great about your company, maybe the investor will remember one or two of them. One of them has to be remembering what you do. And so, the goal of you being on stage is not to say all the things that's great about your company, it is to get people to want to have a conversation with you, to say, like, "I can't ignore having a conversation with that person." That's what a great pitch does.

And what that means is, you don't make the slides be the thing that they remember. You wanna make yourself. It's about your presence, the way you talk, how confident you are, etc. Basically, do you present yourself in a way that people go, "I wanna interact with you."? And so, the presentation is more about making the founders look formidable and impressive to use a language that everyone understands and is clear, but feels inevitable. And so, the goal is not to do all this fancy stuff. It is to do very simple fundamentals and talk about them in a way so that everyone will understand. Right there.

Man 2: I applied a couple of times and the one question that's always the bane of my existence is the, "What's the surprising or amusing thing that you've noticed about the world?" Could you provide some clarity in terms of what you're looking for there? Is it something about the business or is it like something witty? Like, I just spend way too much time on that question.

Kevin: So, we have a question on the application to YC that is about explain what you...

Man 2: It's like, what's something surprising or amusing that you like to...?

Kevin: Yeah. So, share something surprising, amusing that you've noticed about the world. And he's saying I'm having a hard time with the question. And so, any tips about that? So, again, we at YC, we don't really judge ideas. I talked a lot about how to present your idea. But the idea is a reflection of how you think. So, everything that we have in the application is to try to understand more about the team and the people who are behind the company.

So, a question like that is very obvious. It lets us know, how do you think about stuff? What do you find interesting or amusing? Because part of it is that YC is optimized to spend time with lots of people every single week for dinner. And I want to spend time with people I like, people who are not assholes, and are kind of interesting. Right? And so that kind of question, it's a basically a dating question, to letting me know, it's like, "Oh, I wanna buy this guy dinner." Right here.

Man 3: In my example, it's a very specific financial problem that I'm trying to attack. So, should I work on trying to make that very complex in very specific problem, something that anyone understands? Or should I talk to the right people that understand that type of problem?

Kevin: Gotcha. So, the question is he's working on a very complex FinTech solution or app. And he's wondering, it's like, how do I balance this talking to the right people so I can use jargon and who understand the complexity versus making a version of the idea that everybody can sort of understand? The answer is you have to do both. So, everyone that you're talking to at industry, your users, customers, or your business partners, you get a shortcut with them. And that's most of the people you're gonna interact with. And the thing to know about that is you need to have that developed, right? That customer or business partner speech so that you're efficient and talking with them.

The thing is, you also have this other one, if you're interested in outside investment, having the press want to talk about you, etc. You need to have a good storytelling narrative for non-experts. So, really, it is not one or the other is how you have to do both. And the thing is for FinTech people, because there's so much around all these other people who just understand this stuff, they rarely practice the other thing, because they just assume it's always going to be like that. But when they come to YC, it's the first time they want money from investors who might not know about their space or they wanna talk to press who's not gonna understand what they're doing, etc. Right here, sitting down.

Woman: How do the best, most memorable applications make you feel?

Kevin: So, how do the best, most memorable applications make me feel? Probably the best ones. Make me go like, "Fuck. I wanna join their company." That's like the best ones, right? It's like, "Man, these guys seem really cool, they're super smart. I feel like I'll learn a lot of stuff from them. Man, how do I get on their bandwagon?" Right. Like, I'm thinking about quitting YC. So, would be, like, the best ones possible.

In the second tier, it's really just like, I'm energized. Because when I'm reading tons of applications, I just don't understand what's going on or I feel like people wasted a lot of time on the wrong stuff. I'm just getting frustrated. Like, when I hit an application where all of a sudden it goes like, "Oh, it's a breath of fresh air." And I like, "I wanna spend time with them, I wanna ask them a bunch of questions, I get very curious and then I like want to jump around the room." I'm a very active guy.

So, like, think if like Adora got excited. She'd like drink a glass of water something like that. But really, the best ones are the ones that makes us wish we had done the company or that we would join them. That's the best. Right here.

Man 4: Why or the how are very important for the idea, how can you include them?

Kevin: How can I what?

Man 4: Include them?

Kevin: Oh, okay, yeah. So, I talked a lot about focusing on the what and then kind of avoid the how and the why, but they might be really important. How do I include them? You will not include them in the description. They will be included elsewhere. So, there's questions on the application that asked you about how are you gonna get your users, what is an insight that you understand about the business no one else does, how you came across this, etc. So, there's opportunities elsewhere.

One thing to keep in mind is, I would highly recommend trying to keep your answers within one to two paragraphs at the most. That makes it for an application that's very skimmable by me. So, the whole thing is the how and why is important, but you can't just say it all at once. Like, sometimes you'd like to talk to someone and they're telling you a story, but they're trying to tell everything about everything all at once. And it feels like he's not giving you time to breathe or think. You wanna sort of avoid that context. Right over there, enthusiastic curly hair.

Man 5: How do you know a company is on the right track to getting product-market fit?

Kevin: How? That sounds like a together question, but I'll answer it. So, how do you know if a company's on the right path to product-market fit? So, if you have to ask a question, do I have product-market fit? The answer is probably no, you probably don't. Right? But if you're so busy, and you're frightened that the company is gonna fall apart, because you have so many customers coming in asking stuff for you, you're just figuring out how do I hire? How do I serve everyone that wants to come to me? You're too busy to ask that question because you're just making money hand over fist, that's product-market fit, you're on the right path.

The whole thing is it feels like something else, changes in the company. It feels like you're out of control. So, if you are in control of your company, you feel like you can relax and you're sleeping well, you're not on the right track. Very few companies ever experience this. Far back .

Man 6: Okay. Well, if you can talk about your experience doing this because right now, you're on the other side of the stories, but you can go back to when you were applying to Y Combinator on and making this exciting?

Kevin: So I tell a small anecdote about when I applied to YC, and about how this sort of applies. When I applied to Y Combinator, I was really bad at describing what our company does. So, we actually had pitched two different ideas. They told us to prepare for both and when we got into the interview, one of the ideas they immediately said, not interested. And the other idea we needed a pivoting in the middle of the interview.

And so, the way I had described the company, in the beginning, was I said, "We are building a content management system that has a concept called reversible forms that allows you to both put data input in from the back end, and also collect data from users on the front end." That's a horrible description of a company. And part of that idea that fed that is like, I wanted to be a content management system because what was hot at the time, it was buzz, where it was movable type in WordPress. We wanted to build software like that and we wanted to build a new version of this.

And then I added, not even normal jargon, I made up jargon that I put into my description and I pitched it. And Paul Graham was just like, "Oh, no, what are you talking about?" But he was like, "I think you're building a Form Builder." And then we were like, "No, no." We looked at everyone in that space, they suck, they're really bad. We don't like what they're making, we don't want to be there. Not realizing that was the opportunity. Everyone was really bad there but their businesses still succeeded. And so, that's like the clear example of this from like the other side.

And so, I actually spent a lot of times, like, Adora and I spent a lot of time fixing, mentally in our heads, what you guys are making or doing. And so, actually after we're reading applications, a lot of times, partners have to basically redescribe or repitch back what you're making, so that way they can understand why they're gonna get excited.

I'm gonna do one more question and then we're gonna do combo, right here.

Man 7: So, hello. So, how do you tell an idea that has multiple stages? For instance, if you want to become Z, but before that you need to do X and Y.

Kevin: So, how do you tell and describe an idea that has multiple stages, like you have to do part one, before you can do part two and three. I would focus only on describing what part one is and then later on, you talk about what are the other phases that are important. Now, oftentimes, when I hear something like that, a YC partner will immediately have like an alarm go in their head, and they really are going to push you on. Why do we really have to do part one? I'm gonna push so hard and why can't we go straight to part three. Because what you're basically saying is like...it sounds almost like a defense instead of you saying your strategy.

It sounds like it's like, "Hey, I'm gonna talk about what my company's doing but I'm worried that you're gonna think it's really small. So, don't worry, we're gonna do parts two and three, they're gonna be even bigger." And the thing is, that's a really weak pitch, doesn't sound very confident, etc. Now, what you wanna avoid is saying, like, "We're doing number three..."

What you could do is if we're doing number three and we're starting with number one, but that has to be very efficient. That number three is very quickly can be said and that number one makes it sense. So it's like, I wanna build automated market...I just met a Colombian company today and they wanna make automated marketing software for WhatsApp, for small, medium businesses. And they're starting with hair salons, right. And then they're gonna move on to all the other industries that need help with them.

All right. Thank you very much. I'm gonna invite Adora to come on.

[Music]
hi this is michael with harj and brad
and welcome to the partner lounge
so as yc partners we find ourselves
repeating the same seemingly obvious
advice to startup founders over and over
again before covid we'd often gather
together in the partner lounge at the yc
office to try to figure out why this was
the case and how we could help startups
figure it out faster now that we're in
the remote world we're going to do this
in front of all of you
so
the first topic we talked about today in
the partner lounge is
why don't startups like to launch early
and move quickly
hard to be honest
this is painfully obvious advice right
this is you know yc paul graham 101 like
no one applies to yc not knowing this is
what we're going to tell them right so
what do you think is going on why why do
you think people are getting screwed up
here
a bunch of reasons the first one that
springs to my mind is
you have to know what fast is to move
fast
um
and i i think one of the
things we get to see as partners is
across hundreds of companies and
founders the different speeds they can
move at and honestly i remember when i
first started working at yc it surprised
me right like i thought my startup we
were moving as fast as we could and then
you see some of the top companies you're
like wow
how do you get so much done in a week um
and so i think there's that effect i
think maybe a specific version of that
is if you've only ever worked at a big
company
like you might think you're moving fast
because you're moving big company fast
um
but like start up fast as a whole other
ball game
fast means you have to be a little bit
uncomfortable what's going out there you
know you were talking about instacart
before what are you what how dirty did
instacart look back in the day when when
you saw them go through yc i mean pretty
there's the classic story with instacart
which is we interviewed them and they um
did a demo of the product where they
like
clicked to order beer and beer turned up
um
pretty quickly and i think it actually
turned out it was like arpuva's friend
or someone just drove to the store
to like there was no back end right like
and so that kind of continued during yc2
from what i remember it wasn't like they
had they didn't spend a year building a
sophisticated fulfillment center with
complex algorithms to
you know
optimize delivery times pretty sure they
just had like the founders and maybe
some people off craigslist driving to
the grocery store to pick up groceries
pretty dirty like i think it was a good
ui but they the the product was um very
much hacked together
what's funny because brexit was almost
the exact opposite like when they come
in to tell their story at their batch
there was no ui like they could give you
a virtual credit card and like it worked
but that was it you couldn't see what
you spent money on you couldn't see how
much money you spent you couldn't
all they knew was that you had a card
and it worked one of the things though
that i think is going on
and you brought this up a little bit
hard is that like founders will lie to
themselves they will think i'm the
exception
i know the advice is good in general
i've heard all these great examples but
like we are different brad you were
talking a little bit about like
the idea that maybe i could
maybe i can do a perfect launch so how
do you think founders think about their
perfect launch and why they maybe can't
move fast
well i think the minute anyone starts
making something they start thinking
about
the moment when they show it to people
and what they want the reaction to look
like and sound like and feel like
and yet they also know that there's a
chance that it won't be like that
and it will be crushing
and devastating
and so i think every founder no matter
what they're working on has this like
parallel
universe in the back of their mind of
what the reaction is going to be to
their product
and when they let that parallel universe
kind of win out
over the reality that they need to get
it in front of people faster and not
worry about that it can slow them down
because they start optimizing for this
thing that is just living in their head
and it's not real at all i think this is
image founders have of the launch which
is it's going to be like the launch and
it's gonna be like the oscar ceremony or
something where there's just gonna be
like hordes of people
like and like you're gonna be treated
like a celebrity and so like you don't
wanna turn up to the oscars in like your
scruffy like top and bottoms right like
you want to like you want to spend some
time getting in shape you want to be
looking good like it's just this whole
thing like the reality is like often no
one cares
like you launch
there's no one there
well
the way you talk about it has a fallacy
baked into it the launch yeah right
right that it's that it's a singular
thing there's the launch of the product
and that's just not the case you launch
over and over and over again and it's
not a precious thing
the goal here is to get people excited
about what you're working on and show it
to the world and you might have to show
your thing to the world more than once
before they get it and like that's okay
like who cares you know like um brad you
were talking about like what's the worst
case scenario like what how do you like
how do you think about that like what do
you think founders are afraid of like
what do you think is like their worst
vision of a launch
so i think they're afraid that people
will think their product is ugly or that
it doesn't work well or that
they will notice immediately the thing
that the founders don't like about the
product and confirm their worries
they're afraid that
a competitor will hear about the product
they're afraid that um investors will
hear about the product
before it's ready
they're afraid of all these things but
then when you actually think about them
for more than two seconds you realize
that if you play out the worst possible
thing that could happen after each of
those occurrences
it's fine
one of the fun kind of mental
gymnastics moves that we see people do
is this like oh i did launch
we have a wait list of 3 000 people
we're ready to use the product or like
does it like what are you talk brad what
are you talking about we've already
launched right like
and then and then when we say oh great
um let's open up the wait list now
where's the button let's push the button
no no no
um yeah i think there's a whole um a
whole set of contortions
that certain types of founders have
figured out how to tie themselves up in
so that they can feel like they're
launching they can talk like they're
launching but they're not actually
putting a thing in front of people to
use just yet a waitlist is just a form
and you're not really getting product
feedback from that experience you know
it was funny because one of the best
examples i'm remembering from back in
the day at yc was a company named magic
and when they came up with the idea of
magic they launched two days later
and it was just a website with a phone
number and it just said text us and
we'll do whatever you like
and like
to me like that's the right spirit right
like they understood that they didn't
really know what was going on yet so
like let's just get this thing out there
and we'll start learning live versus
versus waiting
um
i do want to play devil's advocate
though right like there are these
examples of companies that founders will
throw in our face right we'll give this
advice they'll be like
harj and brad you all are idiots
remember dropbox remember ripling
remember a stripe like they didn't all
launch publicly in the first three days
of coming about
which one of you wants to kind of tackle
this one like what what is our what what
is our answer to the uh to the pushback
here
yeah like there are there are exceptions
you mentioned good ones i take one at a
time there like i take rippling right so
i think that i when rippling was going
through yc
they took close to like a year and a
half
or more maybe it was two years to sort
of officially launch um
and it turned out to be right actually
the company is like doing tremendously
well and i think my analysis on that
is
you in that case you had a founder who
was building a product he'd already
built for his last startups an unusual
case right i mean like and he'd have
tons of users um like zenefit was like a
big startup growing really quickly and
then on top of that like
his benefit itself was a customer of
zenefit like and so i think with parker
you got this like incredibly unusual
deep level of
product insight and domain expertise and
so he was actually the example of where
he could come up in his head
with here's what the product needs to be
it needs to actually be like a lot of
product it's going to take us like some
time to build this amount of product and
we're only makes sense to launch like
the mvp was robust um
and he could trust his instincts right
because he had this unusual depth of
experience with what to build
but brad how rare is that how often are
we
interacting with founders
who have used and built a massive
product doing the thing they're already
doing before they decide to do that
again
it's pretty rare it doesn't happen that
often
and it's not always a fun office hour
because you don't want to say
you're you're not parker right
you don't want to throw it in their face
to that extent the thing that i think is
really great about the rippling example
is that the first time he built the
product with zenefits he did not spend a
year and a half
in fact he's one of the i think the
greatest examples of what we were
talking about earlier i remember when i
was working on my company in san
francisco he emailed me out of the blue
while he was in the batch
said i'm working on this new benefits
thing i'd love to come to your office
and show it to you and so
my company is building this ad tool we
spent a year polishing the ui and making
it all great and he shows up with this
um with this hr software that was
beautiful
it was it had it was feature rich it had
everything you could possibly need it
and blew me away
and i thought how the heck did this guy
build this so quickly this is incredible
and what i didn't know was that it was a
bunch of forms and there was not a back
end at the time
and so
that first time when he was not the
expert
in what the product needs to do didn't
have that knowledge that's the strategy
that he took
and then the second time after he'd
already built this he was able that he'd
earned the right
to do the big build and make it that way
i think this is like the common trap
that founders have is that like they
know five percent of the story and they
don't know the other 95 percent of the
story so
that's another kind of thing that i
think people need to dig in a little bit
to when they think of these exceptions
like
how can they be rigorous about making
sure they're
they know what really happened
one of the things i love to encourage
founders to do is to go back to
um something like github and go to the
blog and go to the beginning
of the blog
you know 10 years ago or whenever and
and look at the screenshots from then
look at the feature announcements from
them and just try to internalize
that the the stakes were lower the
features were simpler the feature set
was simpler and they were just getting
on the board and it wasn't this huge
gargantuan product that you think of now
so if we're gonna wrap up here
if the if you're uh
early stage founder listening to this
and you are a parker conrad you've
already built a billion dollar company
doing this exact same thing before and
now you know exactly how to do it right
you should ignore all the advice we gave
in this talk
if you're not
then kind of what harj and brad were
saying beginning you already know
launching fast and moving fast is the
right thing to do so just do it right
just just do it right at the end of the
day
you choose every day you decide not to
launch you choose every day you decide
to go at 10 miles an hour versus 100
miles an hour
maybe today you should choose
differently
all right thanks brad thanks harj thanks
guys
thank you

and me and my co-founder
are pitching on Sand Hill Road.
We're sitting in the offices
of Andreessen Horowitz,
pitching Marc Andreessen,
and Ben Horowitz.
We thought it was going
fun, just like the others.
Ben turns to us and asks,
"Who's the CEO?"
I looked at my co-founder Sachin,
he looked at me, we said both.
(loud blast)
And again, guess what?
It was the wrong answer.
The meeting might as well
have ended at that moment.
Let me walk you through this mistake,
so you don't have to make it yourself.
And along the way, we'll
talk about why we made
that mistake and what it means to be CEO.
Are you ready?
Let's get started.
(lively music)
The most legendary duo that can
and did pull off saying both
to the co-CEO question, is
Larry Page and Sergei Brin.
The founders of Google.
You could say that we
thought we could be just like
that dynamic duo.
What was good enough for Google
surely could be good enough for us, right?
Whoa, Whoa, no.
Look, we had a good hockey stick graph.
We had software we had
software we had built
that we were proud of.
Look, most people are not
Google at their series A,
I know we weren't.
The funnier thing about
this whole thing is
that Ben Horowitz actually
wrote a long formal article
about this in 2013.
He said, "Shared command
always seems really attractive
to the people at the
top of the organization,
like the CEO and the board.
We have two world-class people.
This gives us the best of both worlds.
We shouldn't get caught up in
the conventions of years past.
We're all adults, we can get along.
It looks much less attractive
to those who do all the work
in the organization.
To them it looks like
frustration, chaos, and delay."
That's the real reason
why co-CEO doesn't work.
It's bad for founders and
bad for everyone else.
Everything takes longer.
So you have a hard decision to make.
You have two co-CEOs.
You have to wait for the co-CEOs to agree.
That makes every decision
you have to make much longer.
It becomes life or death at that point.
You slow down so much,
that your startup will die.
(wind blowing)
Back to sitting in that Andreessen
Horowitz conference room.
It was 2010.
How did I find myself in this position?
We didn't know who the CEO was yet,
and yet we were here talking
to venture capitalists
about raising millions of dollars.
(deep sigh)
Look, I didn't think being CEO mattered.
And later I discussed
it with my co-founder
after our series A and he became the CEO.
And if I'm being honest
with you, I regret that.
I learned, you may not be
interested in authority,
but authority is interested in you.
Look, when you're talking about who's CEO
or when you're trying to divide the pie,
there are moments when you and
your co-founders are aligned,
and there are moments when you aren't.
Moments where you have to
divide the pie are the latter.
And the best you can do is make
sure that you self-advocate.
Try to think through what you need.
I'm absolutely glad I worked on Posterous
and I'm glad I did it with
my co-founder at that time.
But, it took me too long
in my career to realize,
actually I needed to be CEO.
And I needed to be CEO for the same reason
I wanted to be a founder.
If it was broken, I needed
to be able to fix it.
If things are broken, are you
okay with someone else being
in charge of fixing it?
If you're going to be
incredibly frustrated
that you don't have the
authority and can't fix it,
then maybe you do need to be CEO.
And that's the thing I wish
I could have told myself
at that moment.
I didn't know myself well enough.
And it took 20 years of
my career to realize it.
Don't make my mistake here.
Look, it doesn't have to be an ego thing.
It's just something that
you need in your life.
It's okay to need that.
It's okay to need agency.
(soft music)
And that was one of the big
things I made a mistake on.
I actually really wanted to keep coding.
I had to decide whether I wanted to be CEO
or if I could keep
designing and writing code
and shipping product.
Writing code and shipping product,
those felt really good to me.
In the moment, I chose
sticking with the things
that made me feel good.
One of the things that did give me pause
that you should consider
if you're thinking
about becoming CEO is actually,
it's very different from being
an individual contributor
or director manager of a
particular part of the product.
It becomes extremely important,
right after product market fit.
Early on, it's all hands on deck,
get a product or service off the ground.
Later there are a few things
that only the CEO can do.
And you've got to ask yourself,
are you willing to drop
everything else just to do this?
Can you convince people to follow you?
Can you hire, can you
manage, can you fundraise
and manage investors?
Can you drive the vision of the company?
Most importantly, can you be the magic
that brings all of those things together,
to build a great product or service.
Being CEO is a very specific skillset.
And unless you are signing
up to do those things,
and do them to the best
of your ability, don't.
Being CEO is not for everyone.
But if you want to be CEO,
those are the things you need to do.
The other jobs are
incredibly important too,
but this role is a singular one.
(soft music)
Every situation is very different.
For some of you watching right now,
you may never want to
be CEO, and that's fine.
For others, you may love
doing another thing,
but you may need to become
CEO to steer the ship.
And for some of you, you knew
the day you quit your job,
that you absolutely have
to get that authority.
Only you can decide for yourself.
Don't make my mistakes,
don't delude yourself
about whether or not you should be CEO.
If you know, you know.
Then, it's on you to acquire
the skills, and manifest it.
I know you can do it.
(soft music)

[32m2024-02-01 16:14:29 +0100[0m - dagster - [34mINFO[0m - __ASSET_JOB - 7c023a81-4587-4baa-bc89-19f6ebf6deb7 - combined_and_cleaned_video_docs - Hi, I'm Harj Taggar, and I'm partner at Y Combinator. And today I'm going to be talking about what I think is arguably the most important part of starting a company, which is finding the right co-founder.

So let's start by talking about why should you have a co-founder at all. Well, I think there's three main reasons you really want a co-founder when you're starting a company. The first is productivity, you can get a lot more work done if you have someone to divide the work up with. And you can get much better work done if you have a co-founder who maybe has complementary skills, so they can do things that you can't. And there's someone you enjoy discussing ideas with. So you can brainstorm and come up with better ideas than you could alone, or have someone to talk you out of potentially bad ideas. So you get a lot of uplift in just the amount and quality of work you can do with a co-founder.

The second reason is moral support. Startups are an incredibly intense and taxing journey. And it's great to have someone you can lean on for support during the tough times. And what I've noticed about the best co-founder relationships is they have this dynamic where both co-founders kind of balance each other out. So if one founder is having a bad day, they're feeling a little down, despondent, and they've become a little pessimistic and feel like the startup is about to die, the other co-founder can just help bring them up a little bit, and keep them going and keep them motivated. And vice versa. Sometimes you get too carried away, you sign a customer and you think you're guaranteed the IPO. And you can use someone to just ground you and bring you back to reality a little bit. And so that's where I kind of find the best co-founding relationships can help kind of even out some of the highs and lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is a startup.

And while you can get sort of productivity increased by hiring people or bringing your own contractors, you don't get that same emotional support that you do from a co-founder. Because ultimately, anyone who's working for you, you're the boss, and they're not as invested in the success of the startup as you are. And you can't really be as open or honest with them about the company as you can be with a peer. And that's what you get from a co-founder.

The final reason I'd say to have a co-founder is pattern matching to success. If you look at a list of the most successful startups in history, think of Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, they all had co-founders when they started. And now I think sometimes people forget this point. Because when you think of these great iconic companies, you associate them with a single person, usually the CEO, who's over time risen to become prominent, famous and a bit of celebrities. You know, when you think of Apple, you think of Steve Jobs, when you think of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and when you think of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, right? I think it's completely true that over time, and we're talking at this point decades, because that's how long successful startups are around for, over that time period, it's pretty common for one person to kind of really drive the company become the figurehead for it and stick out that company for a long period of time. And that's why we remember those people.

But we're talking about the earliest stages of starting a company. And in those days, all of these founders had co-founders that they lent on for all the reasons I just mentioned. So I think it's always important to remember that when you're starting a company, and wondering whether you should have a co-founder or not.

Okay, so hopefully, I've convinced you that you really do want a co-founder when you're starting a company. But what if you're really keen to get started in a company right now, and you don't have a co-founder that immediately available, or someone that you can bring on board? Should you wait to get a great co-founder before you start a company? Or should you just go ahead and get started? Well, I think the default answer is that you should wait because of all the reasons I just mentioned, all the benefits that you get from having a co-founder. But Y Combinator has funded single founders, and we have done so successfully. So I've noticed that there are some exceptions to this rule and they tend to follow a particular pattern. And that pattern is that the single founders, those who start company by themselves, has sort of two things that are true.

So one is they have an idea that they have incredibly high conviction about either because they're solving a personal problem for themselves. So there really no solution is necessary. Or they're a domain expert, they're working in a field where they know for sure the sort of technology that's missing, where the customers might be. So there's all of that because they have such conviction in the idea that they don't need a co-founder to convince them that this is a good idea to get started on. They're ready to go.

The second condition is that those single founders, they are able to make progress on that idea without a co-founder, in the short time at least. And that almost always means that they're technical, or at least technical enough to be able to build the first version of the product so they can show it to potential investors, or maybe even to potential co-founders who may want to join the company. And that second point is something I've noticed that the best single founders are also able to do is not only are they tremendously productive in building product and talking to users themselves, they're also able to run a great background search for co-founders and keep their eyes open. And if the opportunity arises, bring on a great co-founder. And I think the best example I can think of here would be Drew Houston of Dropbox.

So Drew applied Y Combinator way, way back now, in 2007. He had a really solid idea for building Dropbox, because he'd already felt the pain of losing his own files. So he knew for sure, there was a better solution to build. But he didn't have a co-founder. And so Paul Graham, the Y Combinator founder, messaged him back saying, "We love your application, you're great, the idea's great, but we really won't fund you without a co-founder. So come back to us when we have one." And Drew kind of went away, continued building the Dropbox prototype, while also looking for co-founders and found Arasha, who would be later the Dropbox CTO and his co-founder. And he applied again, and [inaudible 00:06:34] And now Dropbox is obviously a tremendously successful company.

So that's kind of what I'd ask you to bear in mind is, if you're really keen to get a startup right now, but you don't have a co-founder, ask yourself like, do you have absolute high conviction in this idea, you know sure that this is the idea that we want to work on? There's no other ideas that you'd be open to? And can you really make progress without having a co-founder? And if those things are true, sure. Go ahead and give it a shot. But if not, I'd really suggest you wait until you do have a co-founder to start a company.

So when you're thinking about bringing on a co-founder, what should you be looking for in them? Well, I actually think the single most important thing to know about someone before you start a company with them is how do they handle stress. Sort of second most important is how well are they going to help you handle stress. And the reason I say that is startups are very incredibly stressful, intense experience, as I mentioned before. And a great co-founder should be able to support you through those and help you through those. Because if you're determined and motivated, enjoy working together, you'll keep working on this startup for a long period of time. And that's usually what it takes to build a really successful company. So you really don't want to start a company with someone that you don't know particularly well. Because even if you've spent time with them in social events, or you hung out together a little bit, you don't really have insight into how they're going to respond to pressure and stress. And are they someone that's going to stick around when things are tough? And are they someone that's going to help you want to stick around when things are tough?

So the best people to start companies with are always people that you've got some sort of personal experiences, where you kind of know the character and how they're going to respond to those tough situations. And that usually means there's someone, a close friend, or someone that you've worked with, under stressful conditions. So I'd certainly recommend that you be on the lookout and think about that when you're considering co-founders. The second thing I think you really want to look for is understanding the goals and values someone has for starting a company or wanting to do a startup. And honestly, I think when I was younger, I used to think of some goals and values as being sort of fuzzy terms. I didn't need them too much. But over time, I realized, really what they mean is understanding the motivations someone has for doing what they do. And in this context, I think it's really important to talk with someone, even if you know them very well, about why they want to do a startup, what are they hoping for? And the kinds of things that can come out are avoiding conflicting goals, right.

So for example, let's say that you really want to build a high-growth, high-intensity, high-risk startup and you want to push forward, you want to raise venture capital, you want to hire a bunch of people, you want to just really go for it. And your goal is to take the company public and you're okay kind of taking lots of risks along the way to get that. That's a totally fine set of motivations, it's a very common set of motivations for startup founders. But let's say your co-founder prefers to take kind of a slow and steady approach. Maybe they're more motivated by building great software for a small group of people. And they will be totally fine if you just made enough revenue to pay yourselves good salaries and just grew a little bit every year. That's also a completely fine set of motivations for wanting to start a company. But the two motivations there aren't compatible with each other and they'll lead to inevitable conflict.

So what I'd suggest is make sure that you have this conversation. And it's not a perfect predictor, because people's goals and ambitions for a startup change over time. I've seen people start companies because, honestly, they just wanted to get rich. And their hope was that they would be able to sell the company in two to three years for a good amount to a bigger company. But they got two to three years into the company, and they loved it so much, they got so excited by the challenge that they kept working on it, and they're still working on it a decade later. So that's totally fine. I'm not saying that having this conversation means you're gonna know for sure whether your goals and values are aligned over the next decade, which is how long it usually takes if a startup is successful, but at least having the conversation gives you a better chance of finding a co-founder who you're aligned with around a high level important stuff.

Now, as you're probably wondering, I'm talking about what you should look for in co-founders, and I haven't mentioned the obvious thing, which is, what skills do they have. So it's obviously really important to have a co-founder who has the right sort of skills to help you grow the company. And usually that means someone who's got complementary set of skills to you, right? So if you're really great at sales, talking to users, getting customers, ideally, you'd have a co-founder who's really great at building product, and writing code, and building software, because the two of you can divide and conquer and get a lot done. Why do you think that's really important? I don't think it's one you should overly fixate it. All right. So more important than anything is just working with someone that you like working with and you trust. And so if sort of the person best fits that description doesn't necessarily have the perfect set of complementary skills, tools, I think that's fine, you should still bring them on as a co-founder. And then you can start hiring people as you need, and make enough progress in the company to get investment, you can hire people to kind of fill in the skills gaps, and that's okay.

Another point I'd just make on this is, when you are trying to see if someone's got complementary skills to you, don't go too much into the details of how well do their skills map onto this specific idea you're working on right now. So a common example of this we see sometimes is someone's considering bringing on a technical co-founder. And they want to build an iPhone app. But the co-founder, even though they know them, they trust them, they've worked with him before, that co-founder isn't necessarily an iPhone app developer, they haven't built iPhone apps in the past. That's not a reason to rule someone out as a co-founder, right. What does matter is that they're willing to learn what they need to learn. So if they're not an iPhone developer, they're willing to learn how to do that. And particularly, they're willing to learn things that maybe aren't glamorous, like startups are often just a grind of doing a lot of boring work to get the thing going. And so long as you have a co-founder who's okay with that, it's totally fine if they don't have the perfect set of skillsets. So don't rule someone out who's potentially a great co-founder because they don't have this checklist of specific skills you're looking for. But do make sure you count them in if it's someone that you trust, you like working with, you've got a good sense of how they're going to handle the stress and pressure of the startup journey.

So where should you look for to find co-founders? Well, the answer here is a little obvious. It's to start with the people you already know. So ideally, your friends and colleagues, and kind of ironically, the best time to find a co-founder are when you're not actually necessarily looking for a co-founder to start a company with right now. What I mean by that is, if I were going giving myself advice 10, 15 years ago, what I would say is, rather than sort of trying to pick a startup idea, and go and find co-founders to work on with it, I would suggest that I just look for people to do projects with. So if you're in school, look around, see who's in your class, who's in school, and like, identify people that you think would be cool to work on a project. And this project doesn't have to be a takeover the world idea of a company, just somebody you find interesting. Like maybe you're into games, and you want to build a cool game together. The thing that's awesome about projects is that it's much less scarier and asking for a far lower of commitment if you ask them to work on a project with you than it is to go straight into, "Hey, let's start a company together." Right? So you have sort of a higher chance of people saying yes, if you ask them for this.

And the other thing that's great about projects is you can work on different projects with different people and you can start developing a taste for who do you like? Well, what kinds of personalities? Like what kinds of skills are you actually good at as opposed to what you might think you're good at? And so what kind of complementary skills might you look for in a co-founder. And again, being in school or college is a really ideal time for this because you're surrounded by lots of people who usually have a decent chunk of spare time. And so you can start getting together to work on things that you think are fun. And, again, kind of ironically, although this is I'm suggesting you don't try and start a startup. Projects that you work on in your spare time often tend to be some of the greatest sources for actually finding great startup ideas and building huge companies. Facebook's an obvious example, something that started out as a project while Mark Zuckerberg was an undergrad at Harvard. And now it's turning into one of the biggest companies in the world. But that's not why I'm suggesting you do this. I'm suggesting you can look for people to work on projects with because that's a great way for you to get a sense of what kind of person do you enjoy working with, and what specific type of personality do you work well with.

And this advice also applies if you're not in college or school, maybe if you're working at a company, like look at your coworkers, like, keep a list of people that you think are particularly smart, particularly capable, who impresses you, and start getting to know them better. And ask them if they're up for working on things in the evenings or weekends. That's the kind of personality...the kind of person who is interested in working on evening and weekend projects is the kind of person that's likely to make a great co-founder. I actually remember years ago at Y Combinator startup school, when it was an in-person physical event, we had Phil Libin, the founder of Evernote, there. And he kind of gave a somewhat extreme version of his advice, which was that he sort of years and years before he started a company knew that he wanted to start a company someday. And so he would only make friends with people that he thought could someday be a co-founder. And now, while I think that advice is maybe a little extreme, if you don't just want to be around people who might be co-founders, there is truth to it. Right? So I think this is kind of the thing where if you make this of a conscious effort well before you start a company, it'll probably the best bet for finding a great co-founder.

But let's say you do know for sure that you want to start a company, and you're kind of ready to go, again, right now. How do you start finding co-founders? Well, again, you start in the same place, you start with people that you know. And what I've noticed is an issue people run into here is that they can be really reluctant to just ask people they know to start a company with them. And it's all kind of reasons, like maybe you're worried about how your relationship will change, like maybe you don't value the personal relationship more than the risks of working with someone. And those are fair concerns. But it's not the right optimization for starting a company, you have to make the ask.

So what I'd suggest, the pretty simple algorithm here for finding co-founders, it's make a list of the people that you know, you're closest to that you think would be great co-founders, and start from top to bottom, and ask every single person there to go grab a coffee and talk to them, and ask them if they'll start a company with you and be your co-founder. If they say no, that's totally fine. Say you understand. But like, who would they start a company with and make it very specific. Ask them, "If you were starting a company, who would be sort of your top three or four co-founders that you want to try and convince to work with you?" And ask them for an introduction to each of those people. So your list keeps growing now. You ask the people you know, if they say no, you at least get some more ideas for names. And then you meet with those people. And you ask them and you simply repeat, repeat the same algorithm, ask them if they'd be interested in being a co-founder with you along. And if they say no, ask them who'd they try to recruit. And so this way, you start growing the tree of potential co-founders beyond those people you immediately know, but at least they're still connected via people that you do know. So they're not just sort of completely random strangers.

The final sort of bit of advice, I'd say, for where to look is go out and try and meet people that just have similar interests to you. Right, it kind of sounds a little bit just like how to have a social life. But this is essentially what finding co-founders reduces to. So if you're an engineer, attend, like developer meetups or work on open source projects, or go to hackathons. Do things where others, engineers and builders are hanging out. And you're likely to find some meets. And if you're not technical, if you're interested in those things, you should totally attend those kinds of events too. But maybe also just attend or find people who are interested in the kinds of things you're interested in. Maybe you're interested in economics and finance, and that's kind of the pool of things, or is a pool of interests where you think you'll find a startup idea. Well, make a real effort to go out and meet people that have similar interests. And in these COVID times, there's lots of online groups and communities that you can join. But even in regular times, there's always ways to find people that have similar interests to you. And because if constantly on the lookout for people who might make co-founders, you have a high chance of finding someone who could be a good fit.

So once you found a potential co-founder, how do you test out and know for sure that you both want to start a company together before making the final commitment? Well, it's not a perfect process. And at some point, you just kind of have to make the leap and hope that it will work out. But one way to de-risk it is to allocate a chunk of time where you agreed to kind of work together. And set yourself a deadline by which time you want to have ideally, like a MVP, or a prototype of something built, or you at least want to have gone out and try it out, pitching some customers and convincing them to pay you if you did build a particular product. These are all things you'd usually do when you're signing up with a new company or testing out new idea anyhow. And do that together, and agree that at the end of the time that you've set aside, that you both have an honest conversation, decide, "Do we both enjoy working together on this? And if so, great, let's go ahead and make the leap." And if not, be honest and say, "Hey, let's go our own separate ways."

So making that a little bit more tangible. If you both have the no other commitments, you know, which is pretty uncommon, but sometimes happens if, say, you both graduated college and you didn't go and get a job because you want to start a company, then I'd say treat this like your full time job, right? Say that, "Hey, we're going to set aside a month or three months. And let's just pick idea we're excited about and get as much progress made as we can on building the first version of it, and going out and signing customers." Even if you can't do that full time because you have other commitments, but then do it on evenings and weekends, right. But you'll have to sacrifice some amount of time doing other things in order to actually spend time working together. But the more times, the more hours you can accumulate of working together on the idea, the better sense you'll have for sure if you want to start company or not. Right.

So once you've kind of done that, let's say you've decided that, "Hey, we do want to start the company, and we want to be co-founders," then I think there's two important points you want to make sure that you're in agreement on. First is the equity split, right, like who owns how much of the company. Now, I think the way to think about this is, your sort of default equity allocation should really be 50/50. That's where you want to start from, right, because assuming that nothing's been built yet, you're at the earliest stages of the company, you're both going to make equal contributions, you both want to be equally motivated to work super hard in the company. And all the work is years and years ahead of you. So there is not really too much reason to deviate from a 50/50 equity split early on. However, we have seen different equity arrangements, and they have been successful. And so I kind of think the underlying thing that you're solving for here is making sure that both of you are happy with what the equity arrangement is, and will be motivated to keep working on the company for a long period of time. Right.

And so, again, usually that means 50/50, but let's just say that you have been working on the company for a little bit longer, or you de-risked it somehow by yourself, and you're bringing on what is commonly called a later stage co-founder, then sometimes deviate from 50/50 might make sense. But the thing I would really encourage you to do is not optimize for the short term, right. So just because you made a little bit of progress and the idea by yourself, and you have a great co-founder, and you're sort of thinking, "Hey, maybe I should take 70% interest, just leave them 30%," because you've made progress in the last 6 months, I would encourage you not to do that. Startups are a really long-term game and you win by making the best decision long term. Right. So if you have a great potential co-founder, and even though you made a little bit of progress on the company yourself, if you know that they won't be all in and fully committed to the success of the company unless they're a 50/50 partner, you should do that. You should make them 50/50 equity partner so you can keep them as motivated and get as much out of them as possible.

The second thing I think you really want to decide is who's the CEO. Now, this can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation. And to be honest, it's actually, I think, a bit of a red flag if it is uncomfortable conversation. And so as far as the actual title itself goes early on in the startup when it's just two or three co-founders, in terms of how it impacts your day to day and how you divide up responsibilities, the title doesn't actually matter. Like early on, you're all going to be doing a little bit of everything, there's like plenty of like unglamorous grunt work to go around. And just because you have a CEO title doesn't mean you get to sort of abscond from them. Right. So practically, it doesn't matter, like, in terms of who does what.

One exception to that might be, if you need to be doing sales, it usually might be good if the CEO is a person, where CEO title is the person talking to customers and users and convincing them because they might feel a little bit more flattered if the CEO is pitching them. And this kind of gets the point of where really the only impact the CEO title has. And that is externally, and I would say specifically for investors. So investors care about seeing that there is sort of a clear leader, and a clear final decision maker or a tiebreaker. And that person should be the CEO. So when you're pitching investors, it's usually better for whoever sort of does most of the talking, whoever is going to be leading those conversations, that that person is the CEO.

And now, where you run into problems, and a very, very common source of co-founder friction we see at Y Combinator is where two people really want to be the CEO. Right. And this can sort of...we can see this in Y Combinator interviews, where you end up with two people who kind of talk over each other, they interrupt each other, they can look at each other with a little bit of content when the other person's answering. These are all really, really bad signs, right. So be honest with yourselves, if you think it's really important to you to be the CEO, and you both feel that way, you're not good co-founders for each other. So just avoid all that pain and heartache and don't start a coming together. You ideally want to start a company with someone who doesn't care about that stuff if you do, or you're both indifferent to it and you'll find picking whoever you feel is best suited to the role for now, even if that changes sometime in the future.

So let's kind of wrap up everything we've talked about. Once you're sure you want a co-founder, which I hope I've convinced you to, once you run the process to find some good candidates to be a co-founder, and you've identified someone that you really do want to start a company with, because you spent a little bit of time working on projects together and testing each other out, so to speak, then you have the conversations around what's the equity split and who's going to be the CEO. Now you're ready to formalize things. And formalizing really means the legal act of incorporating a company, setting up a vesting agreement. This is really important. Vesting means that the shares in the company, we don't all get them at once. They vest over a period of time, and there's very standard templates and documents for this that you should really ensure that you have in place. And then you're pretty much good to go.

And you know, the when exactly should you sort of leap from, "Hey, we're hanging out, working together," to, "Hey, okay, let's like do some paperwork." Not a perfect answer to that, but it's just kind of up to you. Like once you've made the commitment to yourself and each other, that we're gonna make a real go of trying to build a company together, that's kind of the trigger for when you start making things real by getting sort of the legal, corporation and paperwork done. So, that's all the advice I have for how to think about finding the right co-founder and how to make it happen. I hope that helps and good luck.

the co-founders at segment and I'm here
to talk to you about how to set up
analytics and the analytics foundation
to build your MVP and to measure these
primary and secondary metrics so this is
going to be a little bit more of a
tactical guide around what tools are
there and then oolitic space in the
marketing space which one should we
actually be using how do I set them up
cool just before I get started a lot of
you may not know what segment is it's an
analytics API where you can send
analytics data and then toggle on
different tools so we send the cool
market position where we can actually
see what tools startups are using and we
can bring that information to you
secondly we've been around for about six
years and so we have information about a
lot of different startups as they grew
and what tools they used so we're gonna
be sharing a lot of those today cool so
why talk about why even focus on the
analytics obviously primary and
secondary metrics drive the MVP and
product market fit process and you're
using that to actually test product
market fit you're also using it once you
get out of product market fit strict
search to actually focus the team so
maybe there's gonna be an acquisition
issue in the company that's preventing
your growth or maybe the users that
you're getting aren't as engaged or
maybe you're having some monetization
issues and so the funnel actually is a
forcing function to understand your
business and where founders should be
actually spending their time and then
finally all the way from you know to
three-person team to Google with 1
million employees you're actually using
metrics to operate and drive teams so
eventually you have an engineering team
you have a marketing team and so what
gold do you set in front of the
marketing team use analytics for that ok
so today we're gonna cover a few
different things so first you always
start with the funnel when you're
thinking about analytics so that's the
sequential series of steps so your users
go through to actually get value and
then pay you as well then we're gonna
talk about collecting data for your
analytics tools then we're going to talk
about the top three metrics so this will
include primary and secondary metrics
that work for most products and then a
product market fit methodology that you
can apply on top of that and then
finally we'll make recommendations about
what tools are the best in the market
right now that help the product market
fit journey ok so to start where we
started the funnel so we'll make an
example funnel for Netflix which is a
company
super familiar with any b2b product or
b2c product actually has this type of
funnel where you acquire a user you
engage a user over a period of time that
loop is called retention and then
finally you monetize the user and then
metrics both primary and secondary are
performance indicators on top of each
stage in the funnel so I on top of
acquisition you can ask yourself how
many new users did I get this week
versus last week and what's my growth
rate there for engagement you take a
cohort of users so from you know Sunday
to the following Monday you you have you
know 16 people sign up and then you can
track that cohort of users week over
week and see what percentage of them are
still using the product four weeks later
which is a good example of how to track
retention and then we talked about
monetization which is how much that new
revenue did I make this week versus last
week okay and then you apply your own
custom business funnel to this so if
your Netflix we're all familiar the
users sign up for Netflix then they play
videos in a loop the Netflix is
obviously very sticky watching it a lot
and then finally when the trial runs out
you do subscription upgraded and you get
access to more content okay so how do
you collect data once you have this
funnel
so there's analytics API is out there
I'm using segments as an example you
basically want to say user user 1 2 3 in
this case has done user signup event and
they happen to be an organic user which
means they're not invited by someone
else then if your Netflix you might say
the users video played and eventually
subscription upgraded and so this is how
you instrument your tracking and your
mobile app or your or your web app then
you think about event properties so
imagine your Netflix and you're holding
one of these video played events in your
hands and you're wondering questions
about it so you know what video art is
the user actually playing how long is
the video how far did the person get
inside of the video right equivalent if
you're holding a subscription upgraded
event you're going to want to derive
monetization as a Northstar metric so if
you're a subscription business you want
to send your monthly recurring revenue
if you're a transactional business like
e-commerce or retail you want to send
the actual value of the transaction okay
so then you push this out into your web
app your mobile app then you start
seeing the data come in you look at the
debugger you see okay user signup is
here every
good you add your first analytics tool
will use amplitude as a good example
here amplitude and Mixpanel are pretty
awesome analytics tools out in the
market right now and then you start
seeing data flow inside of one of these
analytics tools so this is amplitude you
can start seeing user signups growing as
soon as you launched the real like
mobile or web app okay so now that you
have analytics set up it's time to focus
on three different metrics the first one
is the acquisition metrics signups per
week it's really nice if you're a b2b
business to cut this by the invite type
so I you have organic users which are
just signing up from coming to your
website direct sign up and then some
users are inviting other users so those
are invite type right so when you're
thinking about growth it's really
important to think about the organic
user in that case right another example
why if I'm properties are important the
way you create this is you go to
amplitude you say event segmentation
report user sign up next here's your
graph right so it's as easy as that just
website some data gets to amplitude and
then you can see the amount of organic
users every week and then if you're
working on the acquisition step as a
secondary metric you can basically say
today 218 users organically signed up in
the last week but by the end of the
month we want that to be at 300 and
we're gonna execute projects a B and C
this month and then we're gonna watch
this graph every single day on a TV
dashboard in our office or apartment
wherever we work and then we're gonna
see if our efforts are actually driving
this right so that's an idea of data
driven operation of a team you set a
metric and a goal and then you drive
towards that every day okay the second
one is retention to cohorts so someone
recently asked about retention what
we'll talk about that right now
so with retention you want to think
about cohorts of users so you want to
say Monday to Sunday let's say December
10th through the 7th December 17th 16
users signed up and then you look at
those 16 users as they use your product
on a week 0 which is their signup week
week 1 a week 2 week 3 and week 4 and
the general idea here is like you can
convince your mom or your grandma to use
your product once but even your mom or
your grandma won't continue to come back
and use your product over time every
single week right and so if you see
users that are addicted that are coming
back week over week that's a really good
sign of product market
fit so this business can see that the
December tenth cohort only 6.25% of
those users are still around on a week
four and that's a pretty low amount
right so you probably want that to be
somewhere between 20 or 30 at least and
so you can set a goal saying I'm going
to talk to a bunch of these target users
and try to figure out you know why
they're not getting value out of the
product and then make some changes as
well okay so what metric do you actually
pick this is taken from one of gustaf
slides pretty awesome you think about
what value your company is giving to
your users so Airbnb gives you value by
letting you stay at different rental
properties around the world right and
they want you to do that at least one
time a year otherwise they consider you
a churned user equivalently Facebook
gives you value by letting you look at
the newsfeed and you know connect with
your friends and they want you to do
that at least daily or monthly once and
so when you think about product market
fit
you basically have these two different
curves that happen so we have that
cohort of 16 users that signed up in one
a week and we track them over time and
so what ends up happening is for
products that don't have product market
fit they end up tending to go to zero
because people just don't care about the
product right and that's definition
product market fit for those tools and
the products that do have product market
fit you'll see some kind of natural
plateau don't mind this axis it should
be somewhere you know between 20 and 30
percent at least okay so how do you
create this graph it seems kind of
complicated right luckily both Mixpanel
amplitude have really awesome reports
for this so in amplitude it's a
retention analysis report you say users
enter the cohort with user signup and
then they return with the video player
to the subscription upgraded event
that's the value event and then you
press next and out comes this graph and
then you could look at for week
retention for cohorts improve the
product and watch as new cohorts that
strike the four week mark do better or
worse right and that shows you whether
your changes week over week are actually
improving okay finally a revenue so this
is the primary metric they want to be
thinking about you'll use for a
subscription business the subscription
upgraded event you'll do a property sum
over new plan monthly recurring revenue
you press next and outcomes your weekly
that your revenue graph and then you
could set monthly goals on top of this
to make sure you're growing
the at the rates that you want to be
okay
finally I if you have a founding team
it's really good to basically put all
the stuff on a dashboard and then put
this dashboard on a TV in your office
it's incredibly incredibly important
basically this is kind of the the
difference between being a data-driven
team and not a data-driven team a lot of
founders actually set up their analytics
but then don't look at them ever again
because it can be painful right while a
data-driven team will put it on a TV and
talk about projects talk about what
those projects are actually changing the
metrics that they're trying to drive and
then just completely understand the
business every single day right and this
kind of company in this kind of founder
will actually scale to build better high
performance companies because the next
team of employees they hire will also be
looking at that same TV dashboard and be
driven off those same metrics so really
important get a TV next what you want to
do is have some kind of social
accountability around your metrics so if
you have your friends your parents your
advisors your investors package up how
your business is doing into an email
this helps you synthesize what is
actually happening and then send it out
to to those advisers and tell them where
the business is struggling and what your
plan is to fix it this allows the
advisors to quickly understand the
business and then respond back with much
more appropriate advice cool and now
we'll go into the startup stack so these
are tools that we recommend that help
this kind of tactical process of setting
up these metrics so I'm gonna talk a
little bit about that MVP business
business workflow that that Michael
talked about earlier so initially you're
building an MVP segment built about
seven different MVPs before we actually
found segments and all of those failed
and eventually we found we found one
that worked and the process of actually
building that BP is incredibly important
so once you have that little experiment
built you want to enter private beta
which basically just means getting like
10 20 30 customers to actually try this
product and then having very direct
lines of communication open with them
what segment does nowadays every new
product we ship we open slack channels
with each one of our customers and we
have the product managers sit in those
slack channels and talk with the
customers for the products that don't
get product market fit the customers
just stop responding and we're asking
asking asking they're not responding
right and for the products that do have
product market fit the customers are
immediately being like oh
we don't why don't you have this feature
this is broken might I tread inviting my
team and this is network not working so
instead of you kind of pulling at the
customer the customer starts pulling at
you that's that's a good feeling of
product market fit okay so at some point
the private beta is going well you feel
like people really care about this you
understand your target customer then you
want to get a larger market segment to
use it
that's the launch that we talked about
earlier try to get there as quickly as
possible and then a launch is just more
users that you get to test product
market fit on and so if you feel product
market fit there then you can start
scaling the company right and you hire
salespeople and you start doing paid
paid marketing and things like that so
different tools will guide you
throughout this throughout this process
so as you're building an MVP and you're
about to give it to the first group of
customers install Google Analytics
install amplitude Google Analytics will
tell you who's coming from the Internet
to your website and an amplitude will
tell you which features are they using
how engaged are they with that feature
set unless you're able to stand over the
shoulders of all of your users 100% of
the time analytics is the next best
alternative for that we also install
live chat on the page
so either slack with your customers or
if you can't do that then maybe have a
live chat available in the beginning of
segment customers would ping us you know
day and night and that's where we got
the most valuable feedback from them so
just as many open channels of
communication as possible next data
warehouse this is something that we
recommend it used to be expensive is no
longer expensive today basically if you
have a non technical co-founder on your
team but want to ask questions around
the data and they'll always ask the
technical co-founder we'll have to
provide the answers so data warehouse
kind of democratizes the data not only
for the non-technical co-founders but
for everyone else
in the company that you hire after
company dashboards obviously I we should
probably move that to the left email and
push tools so as soon as you as soon as
user sign up you want to send them an
email I'll talk about that in a second
and then and then a help desk so at some
point you'll have so much support
tickets if you start feeling product
market fit and if they're all going to
your Gmail one founder will just get
overwhelmed and not be able to answer
them so you want to have a shared inbox
where multiple founders can I can
respond okay now I'm gonna go through a
few different recipes of these different
tools there
we found really helpful in product
market fit so the first one is improving
product usability almost every product
that's launched is unusable or highly
unusable for the first three months
while you have the kinks and we see this
with every single product no matter how
much effort we put into it ahead of time
as soon as customers hit it they start
using it in ways that you just don't
expect and so there's this tool called
full story which helps you look at
sessions of customers as they use your
website so I'll tell a quick story on
this this is a new feature in personas
which is one of segments products and we
launched them the metrics looked
horrible so like customers are coming in
but they weren't actually completing it
they weren't they weren't using the
product and we thought oh god you know
this likely doesn't have product market
fair we have to go back to the drawing
board
then one of the designers and her team
had this amazing idea let's look at the
full story and so we see this user going
in about to start this creation workflow
they find this button they clearly don't
understand what the button does they get
so frustrated they just exit the page
and so we saw this with a multiple with
multiple different customers coming in
and so we're like okay we just have to
fix that button we fixed that button
immediately all the metrics got better
right and so that's why it's important
to have this type of viewing either to
stand over your customers shoulders
which is great what the stripe
co-founders did or get a full story
which is more scalable way to do that
okay I call this the 43 minute founder
email so when we launch a segment we
would wait about 43 minutes and we would
email the code or email the customer and
say hey I'm Ilya thanks so much for
signing up for segment your next step
here is to add a source to segment and
if you have any questions at all please
email me or call me anytime I'm
available for you since we launched that
email in 2013 we've had hundreds of
thousands of responses to it so it's
it's the connection between you and the
customer over email that if they get
confused they'll respond to it what you
can use is a tool called customer IO
it's a behavioral email tool which will
say every time a user signs up wait you
know 30 minutes 40 minutes 50 minutes
whatever and then automatically send
them this content and you could template
the first name the company name and so
forth based off of your analytics data
so huge recipe recommend and then
finally for democratizing data access I
say this is more advanced so this is
after you're in your MVP stage you're
feeling good about product market fit
you might want to install data warehouse
like Google bigquery and then mode
analytics is a bi tool that works on top
of it this lets you ask questions on top
of the raw data that you might not be
able to do an amplitude and mix panel
just any kind of question you can ask
for sequel and then even the
non-technical co-founders will
eventually pick up sequel and then start
asking these questions themselves okay
one common failure mode that we see with
customers is trying to pick the perfect
tool mix panel or amplitude you know
bigquery or redshift and spending way
way way too long thinking about that the
truth of the matter is you shouldn't
optimize for picking the right tool
right now both amplitude and mix panel
will give you exactly the same result at
your stage instead just get through that
decision as quickly as possible but set
yourself up for change in the future so
this is an example diagram that shows a
customer of segments that use different
tools over a period of about three years
and so you can see that they used about
eight different tools between 2015 and
2017 and they either hired someone or
they decided that their tools are no
longer doing the job and they switch
from one set of tools to another so
best-in-class tools change every two
years just be prepared for a change and
don't spend too much time trying to
perfect your choice right now okay this
is my recommendation of what tools are
the best for the MVP process I'll walk
you through them right now so Google
Analytics is for understanding what
users are coming to your website
amplitude is for feature analytics
Google bigquery is to democratize data
access with a data warehouse which is
just a database of data mode is the the
tool use on top of that to ask questions
on top of bigquery intercom is like a
list of all of your customers they're
really good CRM for early-stage folks
full story is for improving product
usability in customer iOS for emailing
your customers once you get big enough
you can start using Google Ads Facebook
Ads to actually do the data acquisition
okay so I'll just jump straight to the
slide when we were really young we when
we were in 2011-2012 we didn't have a
lot of money and so we didn't want to
use all these different tools and so we
used Google spreadsheet for a CRM we
didn't use asana or Trello because they
were too expensive so we used emails and
the only things we paid for we're
basically github and AWS to host our
products right so today happy to say the
segment is now free for early-stage
startups so for all you folks there's a
bitly link down here that will send that
afterwards and it's in the deals and
then also segments went out and we did a
bunch of deals with these customers so
that if you're early-stage you can now
get all of these tools for free so enjoy
that and start using them to basically
accelerate your product market fit
process thank you
[Music]
you're asking about growth rate so
you're asking it if you're starting with
a very small base of users what growth
rate you need to be on to make to make
growth meaningful yeah it completely
depends on the product right so if
you're an enterprise b2b company then
your closing deals for you know 10 15 20
thousand dollars then only a few of
those customers can make I can give you
enough capital to hire more people to do
more marketing entire larger sales team
if you are selling you know shirts and
pants then you probably need a higher
volume so totally depends on it so it
depends the kind of company you're
building
yep so the question is what kind of what
kind of retention period do you want to
look at if I if you're renting
properties like an Airbnb yeah that's a
really good question
it really those kind of periods depend
on the kind of company you're building
so I'm giving one presentation but
there's hundreds of different companies
that that need to apply the information
slightly differently so if your Airbnb
you probably would expect people to at
least come back to your app you know
like how often do people travel right
they travel you know once a month once a
quarter right and so that's the that's
the period that you want to make sure
that they come back at yeah so it's not
like week is correct for everyone but
it's correct for the majority of
companies exactly keep a pulse yep
awesome all right well thank you so much
[Applause]
you

are the google founders and still have
all this control over their company
you can look all the way back in time to
the at the moment of the earliest
fundraisers they were not desperate for
cash and load leveraged hey this is
michael seibel with dalton caldwell and
welcome to rookie mistakes we've asked
yc founders for their rookie mistakes so
we can share them with you and help you
avoid them okay so here's the next note
that ayc founder wrote in the easiest
way to fundraise is to indeed have a
good metric that's growing when i ran a
startup
that wasn't growing
i spoke to 140 investors and only got
two angel checks
now i'm working on a startup that is
growing and almost every well-known vc
is trying to figure out how to talk to
us it took us one week to raise our seed
round i don't know michael i i've heard
rumors
from around the world that the best time
to fundraise is before you have any
metrics at all
right because once you have any revenue
you will be judged on the revenue in all
like 97 of the time
the demo the product the mvp the mvp
with customers
gives you so much more leverage when
fundraising 97 of the time
well we talk about fear-based
decision-making a lot you and i do and
we talk about this with a batch and i
think a lot of times this is a case of
fear-based decision-making if in your
heart
you believe that your product is bad and
that you will fail
it makes a ton of rational sense to
fundraise
before the world figures it out and
before the world realizes
you know investors see that you launch
it and no one actually wants the thing
that you're making you know you know
that no one wants a thing you're making
in your heart right and so rather than
go and try to sell it and get what
you're expecting
to be really hard to sell
yeah you know it's gonna be a hard sell
so hey let's just raise before we go try
to do it not the best play you know the
other common failure path that we see
is
people putting the investor as the kind
of center of this game as opposed to the
customer
people thinking the investor is almost
the teacher and their job through a
pitch or to a deck is to get an a from
the teacher and the a's money i think
that
looking for validation from authority
figures is a lot of how we are
constructed to look at the world and if
you've been an employee or you've gone
to school your whole lives a lot of the
way you get ahead in life is to figure
out who the authority figure is that you
need to please
and if you please that authority figure
it's the path to greatness and so again
like if you're like a level
whatever
level three engineer at some big company
and you like the way you get ahead is to
impress the bosses
why not kind of pattern match that onto
startups not true if i could redirect
that energy towards pleasing people's
customers yeah people call this customer
obsession like it's a buzzword we're
customer obsessed but take let's take
that literally what does it literally
mean to be customer obsessed what it
literally means is most of your waking
hours
who are you thinking about pleasing
it's your customers and you're trying to
solve problems from them i think this is
a neat trick for an early stage founder
audit the amount of time you spent last
week talking to your customers
building product
right if that amount of time
in your waking day is like 80 to 90
percent you're probably doing it right
if that amount of time in your waking
hours or the last week is more like 20
percent you're probably doing something
very very wrong all right so here's the
next note that a yc founder wrote in
raise what you need and nothing more
you will find a way to spend all of the
money in your bank stay
lean and get your fundamentals right
you know
a lot of founders think money is like
oxygen and you need it to survive
you know
one of the things that um brian chesky
at airbnb told the batch recently is
maybe money's more like food you
definitely need food to survive but
in a lot of places in the world
including america people are dying from
too much food
as opposed to too little food
if you're afraid that bad things are
going to happen the idea of stockpiling
as much of whatever resources you can as
much as possible is totally sane and
reasonable
the issue is
really successful companies the oxygen
they have is revenue from their
customers and the they're being pulled
ahead by customer demand for their
product and that is providing the oxygen
of growth is like the pull of customers
it's funny because like those companies
tend to own more of their company
when they ipo or exit those founders
tend to be happier they tend to have
more innovation because if you don't
have as much money you got to innovate
you've got to do things better or
different than your competitors the
biggest difference between what founders
own more of their companies than than
others
is how
desperate they ever were in the history
of the company to need to raise money
and whether they were smart and had
leverage and they fundraised and so one
crazy story that i don't think most
people know is that facebook
was apparently always profitable that
even when it was a tiny college social
network
they had these ads on the site
way back in the day that made them
profitable
and so there was never around that
facebook was in trouble and raised on
poor terms or raised more money than
they needed and so i believe at exit
this is kind of
why zuckerberg owns so much of the
company
same with google google had incredible
traction this was a long time ago but i
used google when it was
google.stanford.edu
it was a really popular search engine
before they raised a single dollar
because they built it when they were
grad students and had tons of traction
and so the first money they raised was a
very good terms and every additional
round they raised after that they had
incredible leverage and so again if you
look at why the google founders are the
google founders and still have all this
control over their company
you can look all the way back in time to
the at the moment of the earliest
fundraisers they were not
desperate for cash and low leveraged i
think that you just hit on this like
secret hint to founders who you're
comparing yourself to matters
like if you're trying to hit a grand
slam home run with your startup compare
yourself to the people who have hit
grand slam home runs
instead of comparing yourself with like
a local peer group or the company that
just raised at a unicorn valuation
like other people in your pitch
competition yeah god like at a minimum
if you're looking for like heroes to
emulate can you copy companies that have
at least 100 million in revenue and like
preferably a billion there's like so
much more you can learn
from their stories even if they might be
old i guess you know facebook's an old
company now but even if they might be
older
man like you can learn a lot more and
like that's what you're trying to
emulate you're not trying to emulate the
unicorn valuation
you're trying to emulate the successful
multi-billion revenue company
yeah that's really well said michael
choosing
your peers and choosing
who you want to be like is one of the
most powerful things you can do if
you're an ambitious person that wants to
do things in the world is you get to
choose
who you want to be like
you

at a startup this is the first time
we've done this conference since 2012 so
it's a pretty special day for us and I'm
really excited to see that we had such
an amazing turnout in a moment I'm gonna
introduce our first keynote speaker
Justin comm Justin is the founder of
three YC companies he is now running a
company called atrium which are going to
hear about later this afternoon but
before that he was the founder of Justin
dot TV and he actually presented up here
on this stage eight years ago back when
he was running Justin TV and he's going
to tell you some really awesome stories
from what happened back then and talk
about why you should or should not work
for a start-up so please welcome Justin
Kahn
[Applause]
Thank You Jared for giving away my talk
it's me Justin Kahn
I am ycs remedial student I had lost
track actually have the number of times
I've been through I see until Jared
reminded me it's been three times
actually four at least and some of those
companies worked some of them didn't and
my newest company which went through YC
in the last batch and in winter 2018
is called atrium and one of my team
members will be up to tell you about
that later but what I want to talk about
today and it was supposed to be a
surprise twist but no longer is why you
should but also why you shouldn't join a
start-up and I'm gonna start with why
you shouldn't join okay there's a couple
reasons and I'm my goal here is just to
give you the most unfiltered raw
feelings that I have to help you make an
informed decision but there's lots of
lots of good reasons why you shouldn't
shouldn't join a start-up number one the
management at startups generally really
sucks I wish I was joking but no it's
it's true I used to joke that there were
YC companies there are two kinds of YC
companies there were the rocket ships
with bad management and then there were
the other companies with bad management
and that's kind of a corollary to that
it is likely that if your join a startup
especially an early-stage one you won't
necessarily get enough mentorship or
direction on what you're doing unless
you really actively force people to give
it to you second reason you are likely
to not actually get rich joining us
startup it's statistically improbable if
you think you're gonna join a start-up
and then be set for life that is
unlikely to happen so that would not be
a good reason to join
I'm sorry I ever told you different and
then the third reason which i think is a
new reason in Silicon Valley actually is
Silicon Valley has matured in the last
ten years since Jared and I have kind of
gotten here one of the things that I
think has changed is people you know and
originally when I got here I think
people just want to work on interesting
 and it was a much smaller number of
people now I think that there's a lot of
people who come to Silicon Valley
because it's a great career and there's
a great trajectory and there's stability
and if you want like those things you
should not join a start-up I've noticed
more and more people even even people
have recruited more recently a coming in
and saying you know what's the career
pathing here what's the you know where's
the what's the what's the five-year plan
and I'm like we don't have five years of
money so if you want stability I think
you should go join Facebook maybe maybe
not today but next next next week next
week all right all right so now on to
what you really came for which is why
you should join a startup and I when I
was writing this in the parking lot five
minutes ago identified three reasons all
right number one you will get access to
jobs that you're completely unqualified
for and you might not be able to do so
my example actually comes from that very
first work first startup eight years ago
you know I was on stage talking about
justin.tv and we actually recruited
someone from that and his name was Jim
as if he was a from France programmer
and actually he came to work for startup
and got two offers from two different
companies one was justin.tv and one was
actually Scribd Jarrod's company and I
sat down with game I remember in a
coffee shop after work first startup and
he said oh I have this offer from script
and I said what was it he told me I was
like I'll pay you ten thousand dollars
more right now to sign this instant and
so he accepted sorry Jared
he accepted any and he joined justin.tv
and within a year he was running our
entire rails back-end for a site that
was like a top hundred site and I think
a top 10 to 20 Rails site at the time
was like in 2010 so the bar was a lot
lower and that was a job he's like
completely unqualified for he would
never have gotten the opportunity to do
if you didn't join us ARP where we
didn't really have anyone else to do it
and I had he went on actually this is a
pretty cool story went on we spun out a
company called Socialcam a couple years
later he went on to be a co-founder of
that company as we spun it out of
justin.tv went through YC and got an
even greater scale challenge when they
scaled to like from 0 to 128 million
users in like two months and so you know
just the rate of learning for him was
like pretty incredible and he's gone on
to now he's a co-founder at a company
called triple byte that does recruiting
for YC companies and others ok so that's
number one you are going to get access
to jobs you are not qualified for number
two is joining a start-up is a really
good gateway to starting your own
startup if that's a goal of yours in the
second work for a startup we in 2012 I
came back with with another company
called exec and I recruited someone else
actually someone really talented his
name was Finbar and he was an engineer
at Groupon at the time and I think you
really want to break into starts with
the idea of eventually starting his own
and I think one of the things that's
really important is to just put yourself
in positions where you're around people
who want to do the things that you want
to do or people who are like the person
that you want to become one of my
co-founders of twitch his name Emmett
always told me that you know you are the
average of your five closest friends and
he wasn't talking about just me just
talking about everybody in general and I
really think that's the case so it was
Finbar went on he was like you know
working at exact that come but he didn't
work out super good but he ended up
meeting a co-founder there and starting
a start-up which was a horrible idea
there's a terrible idea I told not to do
it at the time but he ended up getting
his start right he was like he became a
founder that didn't work out he ended up
joining YC
for I think in just over a year and then
start a new startup that just went
through YC and is after the races and
doing super good I won't give away that
it's called Shogun you should check it
out and probably work there okay so
starting your own start that's the
second reason the third thing is to
maximize your I should slow down I still
have a lot of time sorry the third thing
is to maximize your own speed of
learning I think this is actually the
most important reason why you should
join a startup and I have kind of two
examples of people who did that working
working with me and they are both the
two co-founders of Cruz and I I think
that they're cool examples because one
is kind of maximizing learning on the
way up and the other on the way down and
I'll explain what that means so the
first co-founder of Cruz his name's Kyle
vote we recruited him at justin.tv in
the early days - he was an MIT student
and we had found him and he was like
kind of this person that we thought we
needed because it was this hardware
hacker we thought we were gonna build a
hardware company and so we convinced him
to come out from MIT and for his like
the that month-long break during January
and we bought him a one-way ticket and
we were like just work for a month and
then we never bought him a ticket back
and Kyle Kyle basically became our VP
Engineering and the use became a
co-founder actually and the VP
Engineering and Kyle's a amazing hacker
he's always has been very amazing
tinkerer and and one of those people
with a can-do attitude he's just gonna
you know if you're like hey let's build
this thing he's gonna go figure out how
to build it but he didn't know jack
about scaling systems or building you
know scalable system architectures and
so that was like the job that was
available though as soon as we stopped
we figured out that we should not build
Hardware and so that was that's the the
job we kind of assigned him and he had
to figure it out really like
on the fly and so he ended up you know
packing this live video system there was
nothing kind of there was nothing there
was there was like no precedent right we
basically built this scalable dynamic
live video system that he engineered and
architected mostly badly at first
actually and it would would go down all
the time
we ended up and there was this one kind
of funny story where you know we had no
idea about like we did no idea how to
build reliable systems and so every time
it would go down we would like call him
which was like every like 36 to 48 hours
and he so he could like never go on
vacation well which is like not really
acceptable to him so it was just like
one time he was just like I'm going
goodbye basically and we're like no
what's gonna happen if you're like not
around he ends up he went to Tahoe or
something like that
we ended up of course like clockwork
after you know 36 hours the site went
down we had no we were calling him on
the phone in like 10 times it's a live
video site so if it doesn't work it
doesn't have any value right like just
right then so we started calling him and
he didn't pick up luckily I'd left the
address we end up having to order a
pizza to go to his house to read a
message to him like a piece of delivery
driver read the message like answer your
phone the website is down so like that
was like our concept of like a pager
system at the time right so really
figuring everything out one step at a
time kind of inventing everything from
scratch the end of the story is he
eventually architected this live video
system that by the time twitch sold to a
Mazon in 2814 was the fourth largest
bandwidth consumer in North America 15
points of presence around the world did
90 petabytes of data transfer a month
and so you know I mean his rate of
learning was incredible as a software
architect and obviously kind of went on
and took a lot of that to cruise which
is also an incredible story the other
co-founder of cruise was my brother
Daniel who met Kyle actually as a intern
at justin.tv when he was a college
student we recruited him
not really recruited it was more like
nepotism I'm sorry I hope he's not
watching right now I just up this
 up to say oh so now he was he he
also had a like crash course in startups
over the next couple years didn't work
for me for very long but when he didn't
work for me he she recruited these guys
to the site
I remember justin.tv when we were doing
like the kind of live streaming site he
recruited this this unknown band it was
called the Jonas Brothers and they they
ended up like crashing our Simon they
were part of the reason that Kyle hated
his life and of crashing the site over
and over again but the cool thing was he
joined as this intern who got to like
you know interact and kind of like make
a deal with like what was basically like
became the number one kind of teen band
at the time in 2007 and then later on
you know he joined me as a co-founder
when I started this other company exec
in 2012 and the cool thing you know I
mentioned that you know Kyle's kind of
the example of like how you might learn
how to startup as the sarbs growing and
on the way up I think Daniel is a
perfect example of how you will also
learn and maximize your learning if the
startup is completely and horribly
failing because we in 2013 by the time
we had worked out exact for a couple
years we realized that the home cleaning
business is not a great business I'd
recommend you don't join a home cleaning
startup and he we ended up trying to
sell it and this is a great story is my
last story this is a great story so we
were we were trying to sell it we ended
up negotiating a deal with a company
called handi that's in the East Coast
and against all odds has survived in
this industry and we negotiated the deal
and I'm like it was taking forever there
was like tons of lawyers it was dragging
and dragging and dragging and I was so
burned out I was just like I'm going on
vacation Daniel you have to deal with it
it's not a very responsible thing to do
but and so he ended up having to be the
one who closed this deal over the next
like month while I was in Thailand I
mean I was like kind of doing stuff on
the phone but he was mostly like running
this
ille for not a lot of money you know
just a bit of stock from handy and he
ended up like it was like a horrible
experience he learned all about like
negotiating we know from and and when
you want to have leverage in a deal when
you you know what when you should like
all the things although different
minutiae of negotiating a deal and he
learned it on this very small horrible
deal which we were mostly trust trying
to offload because we why were so burned
out we want to get out of the business
and two years later fast forward two
years he had become a co-founder of
cruise cruise had built an amazing
technology team that was executing super
well and you know you guys know the end
of the story they end up selling to GM
for a billion dollars and he applied the
cool thing I think is that Daniel
applied all those horrible lessons he
learned from like trying to negotiate
this shitty piddling deal for our
company to his next company and ended up
you know they sold it for over a billion
dollars so you're gonna learn something
whether the company succeeds or fails
you'll probably walk away with something
valuable the last thing I'll say is that
the way I think about it is the way I
think I think about growing and like
your your your speed of Laurium
maximizing your speed of learning is
from a quote that our YC partner Paul
boo Hyde had as generally said I think
he says it to every batch which is that
you know it's not your y-intercept but
it's your slope that's important and so
I think you wanna you know the way I've
always thought about it is how do I
figure out ways that I could put myself
in the position to maximize my own
personal rate of growth and rate of
learning and I suggest that you do the
same regardless of whether that's at a
startup or not all right best of luck
next up I'm supposed to introduce you
I'm sorry I forgot next we have YC
president Sam Altman
[Applause]
all right Justin covered a lot of what I
was gonna talk about so I'm gonna have
time for questions
that was awesome though so I want to
talk about how to pick which startup to
work at the most important
considerations you all already know
picking a company you're excited about
people you're excited about a role
you're excited about that's more
important than the rest of the stuff I
have to say but that's also intuitive
and so I'm gonna talk about the things
that are not intuitive or at least
haven't been for me and I want to just
echo one thing that Justin said because
I think it's so important every job I've
ever had and probably every job Justin's
ever had as well Osby for myself at
least I've been wildly unqualified for
and doing that I think is like the
number one secret to having a really
great career like that's the way you
have a super fast rate of personal
growth and I think the way careers go is
you should put in the most of the effort
at the beginning because there's it's
this compound interest like thing where
the work you do now the learning you do
now the improvement you make early in
your career gets to pay off for all the
rest so you may as well work hard and
take a chance on a role that you feel
unqualified for early and if you flame
out you flame out and you go try
something different but my experience is
when someone does role they're
unqualified for it either goes way worse
or way better than expectations and a
lot of the times it goes away better and
if you hold yourself back from doing
this because you're afraid of not
working out which is totally
understandable sometimes it doesn't I
think you missed this opportunity to
have the sort of most impactful career
you can and that is what's so cool about
startups is you can get jobs you are
qualified for so I want to talk about
how to pick a startup and I want to talk
about this from the perspective of being
an investor because I think what you're
doing when you go to work at a start-up
is making one big investment if you're
really good you are going to take way
less cash comp you can then you could
get at Google or Facebook and you are
going to be compensated for that by
investing your time in the startup in
return for equity so people have
different risk Awards write-offs you
might want a later stage startup with
its
lower-risk or return you might want
high-risk high-return a very early-stage
startup but I think the right framework
of this is to think about it like you're
investing in a start-up and for me at
least learning to invest in startups was
deeply counterintuitive and I'm gonna
talk about eight things that I learned
about how to evaluate startups for
investment this mostly applies to sort
of the stage of startups you'll see here
today number one this is a Paul poo
height another probably height ISM it's
more important that a start-up have a
small number of users that really love
the product rather than a lot of users
they really like the product most
startups either have no one who cares at
all or a lot of people who are kind of
like yeah that's okay very rare to find
a start-up where people love the product
so much they spontaneously tell their
friends but if you think about the
really big companies today Google
Facebook you probably heard about it cuz
someone was like this is awesome you got
to sign up and you know people talk
about product market fit all this other
stuff I think it's sort of hard to
evaluate but one thing you can do is
either like talk to some users of the
company or ideally you are one yourself
or know some and like is this product so
good that people are telling other
people they've got to use it and that I
think matters much more than the vanity
metrics number of users current growth
rate whatever that most startups throw
around so if you only do one piece of
diligence this is the one I would do
number two trust in exponential growth
and as a byproduct of that trust in
momentum momentum is sort of this really
important concept to startups if things
are feeling good if it's growing if
people are loving the product if good
people are joining that tends to keep
going and if that falters it's very hard
to get it back so does the startup have
a good sense of momentum and is there
some sort of exponential growth model by
the way I've been investing in startups
for like I don't know eight or ten years
now I still have not managed to get good
at intuiting exponential growth in my
head so I have to do it in the
spreadsheet every time but I've learned
to trust it and if it's if it's if a
startup is growing exponentially and
it's not fake it's not like you know
they're buying all the users or
something
it tends to keep going and making that
leap of faith because almost no one
understands
just how powerful exponential growth is
even if they say out loud they do making
leap of faith and trusting that is super
valuable related concept this is the
third one the size of the market today
matters almost not at all it is the
growth rate of the market and how big
the market will be in ten years so I
think the number one mistake investors
make when they miss out on a really
great opportunity is they look at the
size of the market today
now they only care about how fast the
startup is growing they don't care about
the size of the revenue today and why
they can't make this same leap of faith
for the market I've never understood but
if you make a really great decision on
what startup to join it will probably be
a smallish market today that's growing
really quickly you know I saw this
morning on the way down here this is
like the 10-year anniversary of the
iPhone App Store so ten years ago not
very long the size of the market for
iPhone applications with zero dollars
and a lot of investors you know somewhat
rationally but obviously wrongly said
all right well we're not investing in
these iPhone apps because this is a
small market I also saw it this morning
the uber deck when they first raised
money and they said you know their tam
is like two billion dollars or something
and if you think about the world from a
certain set of constraints that was true
but it turns out that like the market of
people that want to move around cities
easily grows quickly when you have a
better product so thinking about the
growth rate of the market not just the
growth rate of the startup super
important if you're going to identify
something really big and in a related
concept to that is the biggest companies
that we have been able to be a part of
and I think the biggest companies in the
technology industry as a whole
happen when there's a technological
platform shift so for example the I've
stick with the iPhone example the iPhone
App Store launches in 2008 in a period
of say 2009 to 2012 there were a lot of
companies that you could never have
started before and that all of a sudden
you could you know obras a good example
but there's other ones like snapchat
which really just didn't quite make
sense before mobile phones and
apps and so trying to identify these
platform shifts that's that's another
place where I think you can find almost
all of the big startups most people are
wrong about this so you have to learn to
trust your own intuitions here it's very
hard to differentiate between real
trends and fake trends the technology
journalists in particular seem easy to
trick about this but honestly so is
everybody and so if you read the news
you're not gonna find the answer here if
you talk to most people you're not going
to find the answer here but if you think
hard and you really pay attention
sometimes you can that the metric that I
use to differentiate between a real
trend and a fake trend is similar to
loving a product it's when is there a
new platform that people are using many
hours every day so the iPhone comes out
not that many people buy it but they use
it all day VR headsets come out a lot of
people buy it but they never come off
the shelf so VR by that metric is not
yet a real trend and at the point where
people start you know having their
headset on hours a day that might be a
good time to start a VR company the
fifth consideration is the company
exciting and here's why that's important
the hardest thing to get especially
right now in Silicon Valley is critical
mass of talented people at one company
it's easy to get the first few employees
you can give them a ton of equity give
them big job titles but that stops to
work and then you get to employee 30
employee 300 why are they still gonna
join rather than start their own startup
join a small startup go to Google and
and this ability to have an exciting
enough mission to be able to concentrate
talent this is why I think it's easier
to start a hard startup an easy startup
because people care and if you don't
have this it's really hard I have
basically in my life tried had to
recruit a lot for two different startups
one was a company I started a long time
ago they did social networking on
iPhones
and another was open AI and in the first
one we could tell people like hey you
know like you should come do this it's
really cool and it was kind of cool and
open I we can say like you know if we
don't do a good job or if someone does
not do a good job building a G I like
the world will vary
likely get destroyed and we need you
specifically to do this piece of it and
if you don't do that it's really bad for
the world and that is a really hard
pitch to say no to and so a startup that
has a reason why people need to join it
is super powerful the sixth one is hot
it's thinking about how impressed you
are by the founders and the early
employees at the startup so as a general
observation it is extremely powerful
whenever you can identify something in
the world that is true and important and
that most people don't believe and in
fact I think this is one of the two
major market inefficiencies that
startups get to exploit there exists a
small number of founders in the world
that are so good that they end up
bending the world to their will and they
can do this without a lot of business
experience and they are like hundreds of
times more effective than people that
aren't like this and you know there are
programmers that are I know people hate
the 10x engineer mean because it's so
often used to justify being a jerk but
there are plenty of people who are ten
times as good as average programmers and
also nice people and in companies where
you find a lot of these people
concentrated in the early hires this is
a huge deal and these startups
consistently outperform and the quality
of the early people at a company the
quality of the founders is so
determinant of success and it has such a
bigger impact than people like to
believe or want to believe about the
world that when you find this it is one
of these secrets about the world that is
critically important and that people try
not to believe so I think that's a
really great thing to look for the other
the other big market inefficiency to
look for is ideas that sound bad but are
good so most ideas that sound bad are
unfortunately bad and you should try not
to join those companies but there exists
a class and this is where YC has made
most of its money of ideas that sound
bad but are good if an idea is good and
sounds good then the big companies will
try to do it and usually I'll compete
you but there's a really important
difference between startups and big
companies if you have the same
idea at a big company and you want to do
it you have to get your boss to say yes
your boss's boss to say yes your boss's
boss to say yes and then sundar to say
yes and then Larry Page to say yes and
in that chain of 21 no kills the entire
idea and if the idea sounds bad someone
will rationally so say no if you're a
startup you may also have 20
conversations you may go up and down
Sand Hill Road trying to convince
someone to fund it but you only need one
yes and the one yes you get to go do it
even if it's 19 knows it's it's very
different than one has to happen at a
big company so one idea I often ask
startups is can you tell me why this
idea sounds bad to the big companies but
actually is good um and then a final
thing that I look at are what this has
been a long-standing YC metric what are
the smartest sort of recent college
graduates excited about in our
experience now over more than you know
13 years the YC has been in business
that group of people consistently is 3-4
years ahead of what investors focus on
and that has been a model for us of
identifying real trends before they
happen that group is not always right
there have been some big failures but
directionally speaking young people I
think have more time they're more on the
forefront of technology they're less
than in their ways whatever it's for
that you know what what those people are
going into is an area that we have
always looked at so another question
that's related to all of this is how to
get good advice about what startup to
join and you have to choose the peers
whose opinion you care about in your
life very very carefully most people
will have bring whatever biases they
have about what a career should look
like or what a safe choice is or what a
good thing to work on is they'll bring
all that to the table and most people
have let bad processes and behind their
firewall and they will give you bad
advice and so trying to
find a group of people that you can go
to in your life so whenever you have a
big career decision that are kind of
open minded and intellectually rigorous
thinkers and who care about the similar
kinds of things that you care about
whatever that is is a really valuable
thing to do um I was lucky to find a
handful of those people very early in my
life I still ping them on every big
decision and the advice that they give
me I think is generally quite good and
very different than what I'd get from
most of my friends so finding people who
can give you good advice about what
startup to join is really important I
was gonna talk about how to think about
equity at a startup but I only have one
minute left so I will say this you
probably aren't getting enough I think
most startups are not nearly generous
enough with employee equity the
difference the amount of value that you
create as an early employee versus a
founder is not the hundred x difference
that you usually see reflected on a cap
table we try to get YC startups to be
more generous with equity and I think
over time it's trending in that
direction but like remember startups
need really talented people startups
need people they could otherwise go work
at Google and make a gigantic salary and
I think you should demand to be treated
fairly for that that's my that was
supposed to be five minutes but there's
the 25 second version all right thank
you very much we are going to start with
company presentations now and thanks for
coming today
[Applause]
hi I'm Jose we're gonna go
alphabetically the first company up is
our Marie
[Applause]
hello YC armories here and we believe
that software is the highest leverage
way to improve humanity but how do you
feel when you hear deploy to production
how is that gone for you maybe
so roll back or fire drill time but
don't worry armory is building a next
generation deployment platform to help
software teams ship better software
faster and we're looking for skilled
individuals that want to grow together
and learn from one another and growing
we have done tremendously last year we
are at $60,000 annual revenue
today we're at 1.3 million there's a lot
more to talk about find our booth thank
you
[Applause]
hi everyone I'm John and at astronomy
are building small low-cost
telecommunication satellites why are we
doing this because four billion people
in the world are not online right now
this is a huge problem there are so many
people out in the world who do not have
the access to knowledge and education
and all the things that they need to
improve their lives the other side of
this is this is an enormous business
opportunity for the right company to
tackle this problem there's actually
very few things in the world that grow
exponentially 30 plus percent
year-on-year and the world's hunger for
bandwidth is one of those things
there really is just a few things out
there you could imagine Sam talked about
growing markets and there are very very
few things with a few places where the
market grows this fast and this
consistently so why is this still a
problem after all of these years and all
of the many billions of dollars have
been spent in space and the answer I
think is captured pretty well in this
picture so this is a picture of what
telecommunication satellites look like
today they are massive double decker bus
sized satellites that cost several
hundred million dollars or half a
billion dollars each with small
satellites we can do the same job at a
fraction of the cost at astronomy Vall
ready put our first test satellite in
space and it's orbiting right now
working great we launched it a few
months ago we have raised a very large
funding round series a from a firm
called in recent Horowitz so very well
funded gonna be around for a little
while see this thing
and we have a spectacular team of
engineers we're just over 30 people now
from Google SpaceX skybox some of the
larger air space companies a huge array
of specialties across software
mechanical controls you name it every
possible type of engineering you can
imagine and really I mean I just can't
say enough about how fortunate we are to
have this team you may have heard that
SpaceX is doing a constellation of
low-earth orbit satellites to try and
solve this problem and the lead antenna
engineer for that constellation just
left SpaceX to join us Ranas yes oh
sorry one other really important point
you do not actually have to have space
experience or even embedded experience
to join the team we have a whole group
of veteran engineers they have put the
operating into operating system in place
this is more application level code so
please do not let that dissuade you I
wanted to talk a little bit about the
company culture so we're very hands-on
we build lots of hardware we build it
fast we iterate quickly you have an
opportunity to learn from all these
different disciplines and engineers of
all stripes like I mentioned if you want
we have something we're very proud of
which we call a blameless culture these
things are hard and we know things are
going to go wrong
and the other thing is we take work-life
balance seriously at Estrada's and we
have baby goats suppose random thing
ever but we'd love to do trips out to
the farms to farms outside of the Bay
Area do these retreats and do fun things
with the team and and that's the Stratus
so thank you very much
[Applause]
hi everyone my name is Chris Szymanski
and I'm the head of engineering at
atrium a tech enabled law firm for
startups and at atrium we're making
legal services fast and transparent and
we're building a platform that turns
documents into data so legal is broken
and we hear this from our clients all
the time it's like this atrium works to
fix legal and we do that with a fully
digitized legal services platform that's
powered by both real lawyers and AI so
our team of lawyers makes better
decisions thanks to our AI technology
this is a massive market over four
hundred billion dollars per year and
it's highly fragmented with the top 25
law firms only holding a 13 percent
market share there's also very few in
fact only one law firm startup whose
tackling this market and that's atrium
we employ cutting-edge ml technologies
and every day we work hand in hand with
both lawyers and you'll see here
engineers and lawyers working together
we're working to transform an extremely
outdated industry and lowering barriers
for entrepreneurs to get access to legal
services we'd love to have you join our
team we're hiring software engineers and
you'll get to work with Justin Cohn our
CEO myself head of engineering max
Cantor our head of data and our twenty
other engineers we'd love to have you
apply at atrium Co slash engineering
thank you so much
[Applause]
okay hi hello hi my name is Tammy Sun I
am the co-founder and CEO of carat
fertility we make customized fertility
benefits for modern companies what does
that mean that means that we make it
easier and more affordable for employees
to access everything from personalized
fertility education through text video
voice chat with fertility experts
data-driven learning modules and making
egg freezing IVF and everything in
between all the way to surrogacy easier
and more affordable and so our mission
is fertility care for all the first goal
of our mission is to make fertility
benefits and carat in particular as
standard in the modern workplace as
medical dental and vision coverage this
is a mission that has met it's moment
today even more than 50 percent of
Millennials believe that fertility
should be equal with dental and vision
as coverage at work and so these trends
have helped carat become the leading
provider of fertility benefits in the US
for mid-market companies and moving very
quickly into the enterprise we have
thousands of members who we call
employees across the country and were
operational in nearly 30 countries
around the world
so why join us well there's three
reasons first it's the product what sets
our engineers apart is that each of them
is a key player in every aspect of
developing the product you're not just
simply releasing release after release
you're gonna help decide what to build
next and you're gonna be responsible for
making sure how we measure success after
the release after the release the second
is product market fit so we know that
companies want carat and we're really
lucky and proud that companies who are
working with us love it so we're really
proud to be working with some of the
most important public and private
technology companies in the world
we're also breaking into finance media
real estate and even retail so the
market opportunity is enormous and this
is a really exciting time to be at the
company where you're going to be pushed
and challenged to be doing way more than
probably what you're qualified for and
the last is that this is a mission that
matters um and if it matters to you then
this is my promise to you you're gonna
have the opportunity to do some of the
best work of your life on a solution
whose time has come and in exchange
carat and me personally promised you a
50x opportunity for growth in ways that
you won't be able to achieve anywhere
else so I'm here today with my product
engineering team Pat Dan in a room where
you guys are if you could raise your
hands and please come find us afterwards
to talk about fertility what we're doing
why we're doing it how we're doing it
what's egg freezing and why you might be
our next teammate thank you
[Applause]
hey guys I'm Dave from cheerio and our
mission we call it join people on data
and basically what that means for us is
excels been around for about thirty
years anyone can work with data it's
it's really easy to use but as soon as
the data gets bigger than a spreadsheet
as soon as you're working with databases
of data all a sudden you have to no
sequel you have to be a data scientist
you have to be an engineer to work with
it we think that's really stupid
and we're out to solve that one of the
ways we've solved it is we've created
what we call visual sequel we've made
sequel visuals so it's just
drag-and-drop and we can do it it's a
way better way to explore data just like
windows made Dass visual so way more
people could use computers we've done
that with sequel and it's one visual
drag-and-drop language that works with
all the databases redshift my sequel
hadoop i've liked all the databases also
salesforce Marketo HubSpot all the
different sources of data you can be
coming from one language for all and
then we make it really easy for you make
charts and dashboards and share that
with your whole team so we're in the BI
space we compete with like tableau we
consistently get rated just really
really well there's four main categories
that were rated on in our space we have
a lot of competitors and we're number
one in three of those categories and
number two in the fourth so we do really
awesome because of that we have 800 sub
customers and some really great brands
these guys are using primarily Cheerios
the main data tool and we're profitable
we've done all this with 10 or less
engineers our competitors have hundreds
of Engineers we've done this because one
our engineers are really awesome too we
just keep really good coding practices
we keep minimal technical debt we have
really strong coding review processes we
keep really pragmatic about our codebase
and it's never been a better time to
build more features onto char do we keep
it that way because this will be a
product that that will always have
continually more and more interesting
awesome projects to build on top of it
it's like a data language there's all
kinds of things to continually build on
it so we know that so we're looking for
more soon senior and mid-level engineers
to join our awesome team and we're also
looking for some junior year junior
engineers who are really smart and
interesting learning from a really
top-notch team
so thanks a lot hi everyone my name is
Trenton and I'm co-founder and CTO at
checker at checker
we do background checks we started four
years ago and built an API and then
discovered a lot more issues around the
industry there's a lot of unfairness lot
of inaccuracies and a lack of
transparency and we are working to
change that
every month we work with great customers
such as uber and lyft and run 1 1
million background checks every month
our team is more than 200 people and we
are profitable and making money on the
ensuring side I want you to highlight a
few challenges we have identity matching
Israeli on and it's got to the accuracy
of the background checks we use ml to
improve automation and efficiency and
it's in production platform reliability
is also really key as we process
millions of transactions every month and
it's really at because we work with
10,000 plus data sources that are really
unreliable in unstable and then every
feature that you would work on we touch
millions of users come chat with us and
none more thank you
[Applause]
hey everyone I'm John gun co-founder of
coin tracker a portfolio and tax manager
for cryptocurrency raise your hand if
you own cryptocurrency all right pretty
tech savvy crowd here basically what
coin tracker does is it integrates all
the top crypto exchanges and wallets
into one unified dashboard and with the
click of a button you can file your
crypto taxes to underneath the hood in
order to file your taxes we are building
some foundational tech that relies upon
billions of rows of pricing data across
over 2,500 coins over a hundred
exchanges and it complies with the local
regulations in different places all
under a simple easy-to-use interface
since we started building this in
September we've grown to over 350
million dollars of crypto assets tracked
over 55,000 exchange accounts generating
over $300,000 of Revenue and this puts
us in a unique position to now we can
build even bigger products such as a
unified front end for cryptocurrency
non-custodial wallets and enterprise
crypto accounting software and were
backed by some of the best in the
industry including the co-founder of
Reddit and the founder of protocol labs
the first seed investors and coinbase
and a bunch of others previously I was a
product manager at alphabet my
co-founder John was a Google software
engineer and successful founder and now
you have the opportunity to be a
founding engineer and a hyper-growth
startup come find us afterwards and the
blue shirts to learn more thank you
[Applause]
hi we're crowd a aye and we're building
an API for change detection for aerial
satellite and SAR data why are we doing
this we're trying to replace large-scale
operations that are primarily manual why
is this interesting for you guys to join
well we're solving a two-prong technical
problem right the first is the lack of
training data for segmentation and we
currently have one of the largest
segmentation training datasets in the
world in over 126 countries and secondly
we've built our own convolutional neural
net architecture for segmentation of
geospatial data in fact we recently
placed that cvpr so what are our
customers using our data for we
currently confined roads better than
what's on Google Maps and on open street
maps and we work with ride-sharing
companies and mapping companies the same
product that we have built is also used
by the US government for various finding
different types of objects the same the
same type of tool that we use for
ride-sharing companies mapping companies
we also use for insurance and utilities
companies in this case we find
destruction post wildfires in Santa Rosa
as well as flooding in flooding and
regions after hurricanes we currently
have rolled out a new product for E&P
companies we're one of the only
companies if not the only company that
can find fracking on a weekly basis if
not daily basis why are we so good at
what we do we've got a fantastic team of
10 from Google open AI IBM Watson and
University of Oxford please come join us
as a machine-learning engineer and
please talk to me and my colleague Joe
Garr over there in the back thank you
[Applause]
hi my name is yen hi i'm barsa and I'm
max and we're from door - now I was
mingling a little bit earlier and people
asked door - are you guys still a
startup and we are a startup we're still
a startup it's been you know four or
five years I think one of the advantages
of being an older startup is that the
founders can now send people to events
like this so I'm not a founder but I
represent door - and so what is door - I
think most of you know what we are we're
a technology company that specializes in
food delivery and last-mile logistics I
know we're known for food delivery but
we are actually expanding into other
verticals like groceries so you may have
heard this spring we actually started a
grocery pilot with Walmart so we're
growing very very quickly
now some fun facts this spring we raised
through 535 million from top investors
like Sequoia and Softbank we deliver
food from over a hundred thousand
merchants across the nation every day
and we're expanding into cities new
cities every week and expect to be in
sixteen hundred cities by the end of the
year now there is you know something
with a more mundane service or ordinary
service like food delivery but I think
one thing you should think about is why
do we take it for granted and we take it
for granted because that's where society
is trending so in a world where you same
day delivery becomes ubiquitous and it's
actually the norm you know that's kind
of what we're thinking about and that's
where we are sort of taking our platform
so come join us our booth is pretty
obvious so I you know we're good we were
very good people work with us and and
get you know 80% of a startup experience
without all the risk thank you
[Applause]
hi I am Peter the CEO of Amber's we
issue corporate cards that enforce
expense policies so as an employee when
you spend on behalf of your business the
expense is pre-approved a report is
generated and a budget is tracked in
real time we started the year with just
two full-time founders and we're now at
nine employees with three engineers we
have 210 clients who collectively spend
more than seven million dollars a month
using our product we've been able to
scale our business to its current size
with just three engineers by being
disciplined about code maintainability
and by preserving a simplicity of
infrastructure I was one of the
technical cofounders of a company called
Crocodoc that was acquired by box and
I've had years of experience working
with the other two engineers on the team
together we've launched credit cards
using both MasterCard and most recently
on the visa payments network as one of
the first expense solutions to launch a
product using stripes new issuance API
as we build our business we're looking
for an engineer to take ownership of a
sizeable piece of our infrastructure by
augmenting our fraud detection
algorithms using machine learning or by
designing new bot interactions for our
slack integration again my name is Peter
and I'm joined by Cameron and Winston
the other two engineers on the team we
have the only purple table in the other
room and I hope to talk to you
afterwards
[Applause]
hi I'm Jared see Hoffer I'm the CEO and
co-founder of enzyme I'd like you all to
remember three numbers 4 7 and 10
average time to market for a new
software medical device is four years
for a hardware device like a pacemaker
at seven years and for a new drug ten
years why is that well it's kind of a
complex question but this is one reason
that's an FDA submission and yeah that
picture is taking the 60s we've evolved
a little since then you can send PDFs
now but you're still upset a paper copy
bottom line is that if you're in life
science tech you're dealing with
enormous quantities of data the problem
is is that regulated companies have
terrible information systems and this
leads to things like wrote work doing
paper pushing delays and arbitrary
decision making the good news is as
software engineers we have an idea on
how to fix the terrible information
system part how do we do it well we
combine a rails web app with an NLP ml
back-end that extracts data that users
upload and programmatically writes FDA
submissions and even though we're
working in a regulated environment we
still follow software development best
practices with hourly CI and weekly
deploys to production most importantly
though by automating the FDA approval
process
we're helping Life Science innovators
get their products to market one to
three years
faster than they otherwise would and our
customers are making some really really
cool stuff if this excites you we'd love
to talk we're hiring for both full stack
and NLP and all roles thank you
[Applause]
hey everyone i'm michael from vocal
systems for the past several decades
there's been little to no innovation
inside the four walls of
brick-and-mortar retail whether it be
inventory management like out of stocks
or
bear with us cool yeah so where I was
leaving off his inventory management is
a big problem with inside brick and
mortar retailer hasn't been much
innovation how we find things on sale or
items in the store and the checkout
process in general is extremely
inefficient there's a lot of friction
there and all the friction inside of
brick-and-mortar retail right now is
driving a lot of us to go a shop online
what we're doing at focal systems is we
deploy hardware and software inside
retail environments and we use images to
provide solutions like out-of-stock
detection automated checkout or indoor
location to let you know where you are
while you're traveling throughout the
store currently we're working with six
of the world's biggest retailers to
solve these challenges and we're looking
for deep learning engineers mechanical
engineers web engineers and data
scientists to scale our business come
talk to me at the focal systems booth
and looking forward to automating
brick-and-mortar retail with you hello
I'm Rock and I had engineering for her
her is the largest world's largest LGBTQ
female space and queer consumer app we
run our mobile app that is used by over
3 million users in specific 5 countries
we reach 48 million people per year and
we organize over a hundred events that
attract or ADA gay people our goal is to
make home for world's identities and we
want to make every lesbian queer and
bisexual person feel at home for us our
core values that we feel reflect the
entire team is that were great together
that we foster ownership and
responsibility that we try to learn
and contribute back to the team and we
were kind of lonely oh and we will
always struggle to do more with less
some of the things that that engineers
have done and our team recently is a
deep and wide deep learning recomendar
for meeting new people is this camera
detection tool using NLP and we've
recently internationalized both more
apps first language French for for many
more to come
currently we're mostly looking for
mobile engineers we're kind of looking
for for footfall product oriented
engineers who care enough about UX and
and are going to help us create some
space that has been like traditionally
super underserved into something that
community will feel and take for its own
and we we all work tirelessly on this
goal by by believing that this is
something bigger than us that we're
creating a better new future for a lot
of the demographics that have
traditionally been overlooked thank you
very much
[Applause]
hi everyone I'm Betsy Larkin I'm the
founder of honey love we are a
direct-to-consumer fashion brand that
makes clothing with built-in targeted
compression that accentuates body shape
we are part of the current YC batch and
we're hiring a founding CTO some of you
might not be familiar with this space
but we've been able to prove that
there's a strong demand for our products
we raised over $300,000 on Kickstarter
in the spring and this past week we
started shipping and also launched sales
from our website and in just the first
week we brought in over 30,000 dollars
in revenue and are also profitable right
out of the gate in terms of the founding
CTO position we're looking for people
who are passionate about creating
amazing ecommerce experiences so on on
the front end custom checkout flows on
the back end you know fulfillment
warehouse inventory management software
and then as the third team member you
guys would also be instrumental in
helping us to build out the team so if
that sounds interesting to you please
find me thanks
[Applause]
hello hello my name is Alex Harmsen I'm
one of the co-founders of iris
automation we build collision avoidance
systems for industrial drones drones
that are being used for a railway
inspection farming surveys mining
exploration even things like package
delivery and air taxis about a year ago
pretty much every single Aviation
Authority around the world mandated this
type of collision avoidance system to be
on board
millions of drones everywhere
essentially these drones can't be used
for any sort of beyond line of sight
operations anything autonomous anything
scaled any one of the industries that I
just mentioned without this critical
technology and the way we build it is we
use computer vision an AI software to be
able to allow these drones to see the
world the way a pilot does and this is
not easy I mean essentially were trait
taking these current drones and we're
adding these systems to them to be able
to actually allow them to see objects at
thousands of feet away in real time with
size weight and power constraints this
needs to be aviation quality a problem
similar to self-driving cars but way
harder we do this by modeling human
perception and really understanding how
pilots see the world ultimately it's
software were able to do remote software
updates continuously improve the product
using the latest embedded GPUs and
cameras and we do this by layering sort
of traditional geometric computer vision
algorithms with more semantic
understanding through artificial
intelligence so far we've collected more
than 50 terabytes of data of real
collisions we have a chief pilot on
staff we have drone operators we're
going out into different landscapes
environments different conditions and
collecting all of this data as well as
all of our customers internationally not
just that we're being
we're able to do hundreds of thousands
of collisions in simulation in hardware
in the loop environments we built up an
entire architecture behind the scenes to
make sure that every new algorithm is
tested and is worthy for the world we
currently we have a twenty five person
team we've raised over ten million
dollars these systems are actively going
out and for us it's a combination of
people from the self-driving car world's
avionics
me my co-founder me and my co-founder we
came from Boeing in NASA originally with
lots of experience in the drone space so
if you're interested in any of what you
just heard specifically for computer
vision experts and anyone who's worked
on C++ come and find us we have a booth
in the other room and a huge sign that
you won't miss
[Applause]
hi everybody my name's Andrew quarry I'm
the CEO of level 5 so autonomous cars
they're like a really hot thing in 2018
and there's so much hype but autonomous
cars still suck and that's really sad so
we make maps maps you say haven't maps
already been created no we make HD maps
and HD maps are really different than
regular maps because there are these 3d
representations of the environment
it includes everything from lean lines
traffic lights signs pedestrian
crosswalks pretty much everything you
name it
and so we're mapping this using cameras
and computer vision and how do we do
this well we have a program called paver
and if you have an iPhone you can
download paver
and make money just by driving so we
have a lot of uber drivers on the
platform doing this for us and pavers
are really special application because
it has on edge machine learning and we
really get your phone cooking like we
use metal we use Carmel we use
everything and we're running powerful
computer vision algorithms to do
segmentation to detect cars pedestrians
lane lines buildings we like literally
get your phone cook and it uses 5% of
battery every two minutes or something
it's like it's so basically what I'm
saying is we need people that help
optimize this we have over 10,000
drivers and yeah so we're getting a ton
of data and we have like 500 terabytes
or 500 we have almost a petabyte of data
and so we take all this the
reconstruction happens on the phone but
then we send all these point clouds up
to the server and we aggregate all this
stuff together server-side to create
these really really high detailed
centimeter level maps of the world and
this is like really important for
self-driving cars it's like a git diff
for maps and self-driving car companies
would really need this
but we really need you especially if
you're an iOS engineer or just someone
interested in mapping or autonomous cars
or vision or anything like that come
talk to me so yeah come map the world
with us thank you so every company
you're hearing from today has potential
to shape the world but they all have one
big problem in common they can't hire
enough talent we're fixing that make
schools a new model of college focused
on training students for high-growth
tech companies like all the companies
you're hearing from today we're starting
with computer science eventually we
might look to robotics biotech and more
we have placed our alumni at Google X
we've placed alums at open AI one of our
alums leads mobile at line bike and
about 40% of our students get offers
from YC companies that gives you a sense
of the talent that's coming out of here
but we also care a lot about diversity
forty percent of our students are
underrepresented students of color and
fifty percent are low-income students
we are the first bachelor's granting
institution where students can graduate
in only two years and they can pay
tuition as a percentage of earnings once
they graduate instead of building
software we want you to build developers
but this is not just like any teaching
job this is like being a senior engineer
mentoring and coaching junior developers
our school feels much more like a
workplace than a classroom building
developers will accelerate the future
and maximize your impact it's really
high leverage because instead of working
for one company you're training an army
of students to go work at all of them
you should work with us if you're
passionate about teaching and coaching
and mentoring if you want to build a
scalable system for upward mobility for
all the people who don't have the
opportunities that we do and you want to
help accelerate economic growth
everywhere in the world thank you
[Applause]
got some giggles okay hi my name is hua
I'm the CEO and co-founder of meadow we
build cannabis SAS so our products
include retail point of sale systems
inventory management's automatic
compliance reports and delivery we
process over 10 million dollars of weed
per month and it's growing our mission
is to build the best software in the
cannabis industry and it's growing from
nine point seven billion dollars last
year to forty seven billion dollars in
the next ten years this is our team
we're a team of ten people working
together in San Francisco our engineer
team is four
three of which are my co-founder so you
one of you lucky or two will be our next
second or third engineering hire which
we're really excited about our front end
consists of three react apps the power
of the point of sale the power the
dispensary management system and then we
have one iPad point-of-sale app that's
deployed across all these dispensaries
in California we utilize nodejs and
really run the latest version utilize
the latest JavaScript technology such as
async/await come say hi my co-founder
Scott and Rick are here wearing our
meadow shirts we're looking forward to
hanging out with you guys thank you
[Applause]
welcome my name is Keith with mystery
org we create video explanations for
kids questions like why is the sky blue
most questions that children ask
grown-ups don't know how to answer
eventually kids stop asking and their
curiosity fades away so we're creating
explanations for every question kids
have think of us like a visual Wikipedia
for kids
we're already used by teachers and 50%
of elementary schools in the u.s. we'll
do nearly 8 million in sales this year
and now we're scaling our platform to
answer every question and reach kids
everywhere and we need a couple
engineers to help us there's 30 people
on our team eight of them are engineers
these are teams former Facebook Palantir
Google and we move fast we deploy code a
dozen times a day to production but
that's just table stakes we're looking
for engineers that are passionate about
creating great product experiences
you'll work closely with our designers
our customers you'll make product
decisions and you'll be surrounded by a
group of people that you'll learn from
every day people who've contributed to
Rails people from the bundler core team
people who find Ruby a little slow and
will drop in to see and write a custom
gem but what is it that you're building
this is a new kind of wiki software
wiki's are great for a group of people
to collaborate on creating a text
document we're building a platform so a
group of people can collaborate on
creating video explanations for kids so
come join us if you want to help the
next generation of children grow up and
stay curious
we'll be across the way Thanks
[Applause]
who here rents cool 93% of landlords use
credit as the primary indicator of who
they're going to rent to 67% of people
under the age of 35 have subprime credit
scores in America and less than 5% of
people will ever be evicted in their
life when it comes to renting credit is
broken but we figured out how to fix it
so neighborly is a credit bureau that
has built an AI based credit score for
the rental industry that helps landlords
know who they're renting to while
helping tenants access fair credit and
build their credit by just paying their
rent we give our product away completely
for free and we which includes a credit
report criminal background check
everything we make money selling renters
insurance and that's allowed us to grow
from a thousand to 350,000 rentals in 18
months which is like 1/2 of a percent of
America now using us that means that
every day 20 people at neighborly decide
where thousands of people live which is
a responsibility we take super seriously
and that's what we need your help with
so if you want to solve hard problems
with real-world applications of AI
building inclusive user experiences that
like really need to matter for a
incredibly diverse group of people and
you wanna have an impact on something
that really matters like housing and
credit in America then you should come
talk to us thank you
[Applause]
hello I'm Scott Patterson I head up the
engineering team at notable labs where
we're doing personalized drug discovery
for blood cancer so the basic idea is
that we take a patient's actual cells we
test different combinations of approved
drugs and we see what kills the cancer
and keeps the healthy cells alive
we focus on combinations because many of
the driver mutations are very difficult
to drug with a single drug and in blood
cancer particularly if you start with a
single drug and they lead to a resistant
clone and relapse of the cancer broadly
our goal is identifying personalized
combinations of approved drugs that a
patient can use today we're using the
same platform to do drug discovery so
both internally and in partnership with
a number of pharma companies the
platform we're building consists of our
proprietary biology where we're
miniaturizing the microenvironment
around the cells so that we can scale up
and do the number of combinations that
we need to test we have our custom built
software machine learning to handle
automating the analysis and handling
these complex scientific workflows and
we've automated the whole thing with
robotics and lab automation so that we
can scale up and have a reproducible
assay we're actively hiring software
engineers data scientists and cancer
scientists so if you want to work on an
awesome mission where you can have an
impact on patients lives today with a
team super talented and diverse
engineers and scientists on a modern
tech stack come and talk to us thank you
[Applause]
hi everyone I'm Lucas from Innova credit
I'm the CTO and co-founder and Nova is
the world's first international credit
history platform and we have
successfully raised a series a recently
and are backed by general catalysts and
in expenses and of course actively
hiring and I'm going to tell you a
little bit about about a problem first
and in a solution so what is what what
is it that we're solving for the problem
is that immigrants today they just
cannot get credit in foreign markets so
all of your credit histories that you
have and you're boring behavior and your
payments details they are stuck in their
market and this is a really big problem
there's a really big problem because if
you get into a new market you want to
get started you want to get like rental
you want to you know sorry renting
apartments you want to get a credit card
you want to lease a car so how do we
solve this problem we solve this problem
by having one API for global data so
this is creating one standardized format
across the world for credit history data
we aggregate from database across all
over the world and expose that with one
unique API data points so why do you
want to want you to work at Nova so we
have technical challenges that are
really interesting so we have massive
ETL pipelines we have infrastructure
systems that need to be cross region I
need to talk to each other at all times
and we face a lot of graph machine
learning problems because of all these
database across the worlds so come talk
at us or sorry come talk to us at our
booth we have talented thirty people at
our San Francisco office beautiful furs
and yeah just come talk to us we are
looking for info infrastructure system
engineers spec and engineers for our
engineers full psych engineering
fiscally across-the-board thank you
[Applause]
hi everyone i'm kevin the co-founder and
CEO of pat rice we are yc4 careers
instead of companies so what does that
mean that means we help and mentor
students and young professionals to get
the best possible job and find
fulfilling work everything from outreach
tactics the resume review to interview
preparation and to negotiation advice
one of the things to keep in mind is
that we're not a coding bootcamp we're
not an interview prep course we're not a
replacement for college instead what we
do is we guide you through your job
search afterwards and help you figure
out the stuff in your early career that
nobody else is gonna teach you the catch
is it's completely free until you get
hired and start work the whole point is
that our fellows pay zero dollars out of
pocket and instead we recoup our
investment back from an income share of
their salary only after they've already
started their employment it's affordable
to anyone accessible to anyone online
and we actually have aligned incentives
with our fellows you might want to join
our team if you want to do more than
just code and would love to spend a
significant amount of your time working
with students that are aspiring to be
engineers you might want to join our
team if you want to fix a broken model
of career services that it's ridiculous
how far and how bad it's gotten and you
might want to join our team if you're
not looking for a company that's
building the next big social media app
or gadget you're not looking for a
company that's going to maybe provide
marginal utilities the hundreds of
millions of individuals instead you're
looking for a company that invests in
every single fellow that we go through
and one where I can say that even if we
collapse today there's a hundred
students where we've literally changed
their lives and for those of you that
are less experienced and aspiring
engineers for those of you that are
still students or recent graduates come
talk to us we'd love to give you free
advice and any help you might need no
strings attached
Thanks can't click for me hi my name is
Tracy young I'm one of the co-founders
and CEO of Plan Greg
hello my name is Ralph Judy I'm the CTO
and co-founder of plain grid plan grid
builds beautiful simple powerful
software for the 14 trillion dollar per
year construction industry we are part
of Y Combinator's winter 2012 batch in
the last six years we've helped build
over 1 million construction projects
today we have customers paying customers
in over 80 countries you probably don't
know this but one out of every 10 people
in the world eat sleep and breathe
construction every single day and for us
it's a privilege to be able to write
software for some of the hardest working
people in the world as an engineer what
excites me about playing grid is not
only do you get to work on deep
technically challenging problems you
also get to work with customers that you
get to know that love you that love your
software and rely on it to get their job
done so we're hiring across the board
we're hiring mobile developers that's
iOS Android even Windows we've got web
back-end Python data science machine
learning we're hiring everything we've
got a modern stack just like everybody
else here we're a diverse team of 350
people and growing we deeply care about
fairness in the world in 2016 plan grid
took the United States Equal Pay pledge
and I am proud to share that we pay our
men and women equally we also have thank
you
we also have great benefits for
individuals and families and we pay well
and we would love to meet you plan ger
calm
Ralph move your head slash careers we're
also by this big ass fan over in the
other building so come talk to us thank
you hi everyone my name is Omni and I am
the founder and CEO of poppy our mission
is to build the modern village for every
family right now we're doing that by
building the platform that connects
parents with amazing vetted caregivers
when they need childcare why is that
important well there's a shiny happy
version of Parenthood out there and then
there's the super messy kind of reality
the reality that needs lots of help and
support but for lots of reasons doesn't
exist but we believe that you can do
that with the amazing people that live
in our communities and with a little bit
of thoughtful technology our general
thesis is that if you can connect
parents with the people that they trust
are available when they need them to be
and are a really good fit for their
families you can really approximate that
idea of village and the amazing news is
is that over the last two years we've
been doing that for thousands of
families in Seattle who we've been
creating that experience that Sam is
talking about that you're looking for
that really fanatical product that is
really solving real problems for people
both on the parent and family side but
then also importantly creating really
amazing jobs on the other side but we're
only just getting started if you think
about how to scale this kind of
marketplace there's so many interesting
and hard problems to work on
what is the right matching model when
you're talking about people and families
and kids how do you think about supply
and demand optimization how do you think
about automation when you're thinking
about people and overall just how do you
create really simple and seamless
technology that almost disappears and
becomes invisible within people's lives
so we're looking for people
smart people that want to solve a really
hard really important problem and join
our team in Seattle who is made up of
really fun amazing dedicated people they
really want to solve this really
important problem so if you want to
solve a real-world problem build
features that get into the hands of our
users the next day if you're driven by
talking to users and really iterating
and understanding how a product can help
them and if you want to use your
superpowers for good and live in a city
that you can actually afford to live in
come come and talk to me
you can either catch me on Twitter or
find me at the booth in the other room
thank you
[Applause]
hello everyone I'm Chris I'm the CEO of
precious precious uses AI to organize
the photos of your kids here's the
problem
my daughter is three years old and I
have twenty thousand photos of her in
2018 that's normal
our technology will scan that mess well
scan that mess find the meaningful
moments and build the perfect album for
your kids we believe that this is
important we believe that this is
important because we believe it's very
important to make families happier and
stronger we're early C stage company and
we're only three people but we already
have a lot of traction users love our
early product so much that they've given
us four and a half star reviews over
thousands of river views and we have
sixty two thousand subscribers who pay
five dollars per month to use our app
and these are subscribers over 100
countries around the world that
translates to almost 3 million dollars
in annual revenue with a three-person
team joining precious won't be for
everyone but here's why it might be
awesome for you you'll get the impact
responsibility and equity of joining an
early stage company that also has
revenue and profit on a small team we
really do want you to take tons of
responsibility and ownership come up
with ideas on your own and ship them to
users quickly and finally we're not a
sweatshop
we truly value a work/life balance I
have two toddlers and I get home to have
dinner with them every single day except
for tonight because I can't get home to
San Francisco in time
so in summary we're precious what we
offer to you is a chance to use AI to
organize the photos of people's kids we
want you to take big responsibilities on
our small team and you'll get a chance
to come to work to make families happier
stronger everyday that sounds
interesting to you please come find me
and my co-founder wearing the icon of
the smiling baby later I would love to
chat with you thanks hi my name is
Phaedra and I used to run revenue and
operations and attend recent funded
startup and I realized that technology
actually had the potential to do
incredible good and so a friend and I
co-founded promise and we're helping
people get out and stay out of jail
right now 75% of people in jail have not
been convicted of the crime they were
arrested for they're there because they
cannot afford bail two-thirds of those
folks are bail eligible are nonviolent
offenders who are stuck in jail what we
know is the longer you stay in jail the
more likely you are to go back to jail
the more likely you are to lose your job
the more likely AR you are to lose your
housing the more likely you are to have
serious consequences so what do we do
about it well the good thing is that
there is a solution with software first
most people are likely to go to jail for
technical violations that's like they
miss an appointment with their probation
officer and so software can actually
help figure out how do you make your
appointments where should you be how do
you speak and connect we can do all of
that through software more importantly
we can give people tools about how to
analyze data so that we can start to
figure out who should not be in jail we
have an incredible team Mike to my left
we got from uber who wants to work at
that little startup when you could work
here we stole our engineering lead from
stripe again I mean come on big choice
promise and so we have an incredible
team of people who have not just raised
money from incredible investors like
first round capital and jay-z but that
we are committed to social change with
the best people leaving the best places
to create a company that actually can
create equity
and use technology to scale justice
thank you
[Applause]
Wow what a motivating startup let's give
it up for promise that was awesome yeah
[Applause]
I'm one of the founders of a company
called quartz II I'm Jay and this is
Sylvie and we are here to talk about how
we accelerate the pace of scientific
discovery so what is quasi we've built
the operating system for scientific labs
all over the world and labs use us to
run their operations and the way we make
money is not through the software we
give the software away for free so labs
in India in China all over the world can
benefit from the software productivity
we make money when we labs buy their
supplies from us so what we are doing is
pretty hard we build world-class
software for companies all over the
world and we give it away for free and
we make money when we ship supplies to
them so it's Salesforce and Amazon put
together we have a million cubic foot
warehouse in the East Bay and we are
opening up a new warehouse on the west
coast in the coming year so who are our
customers this is Elizabeth Elizabeth
Blackburn she got the Nobel Prize in
2009 and she's one of the nine Nobel
Prize winners on quartz e today we have
more scientists who won the Nobel Prize
using our application than any academic
institution in the world but it's only
not small labs biology is going to
reshape the way we live the same way
that physics and computer science change
the 20th century biology will reshape
the 21st century and we are building the
platform to make that happen
one of our customers is using molecular
biology to make plant-based protein and
they buy from us but that's not just
startups we have publicly traded Pharma
and biotech companies who use us and buy
from us we have 4,000 customers
nationally we've made 30 million dollars
in sales this year we're a 60% company
so it's a right time to join us where we
sort of like pull out the business model
and now we are going to scale this up
globally and while do you work with us
so what's it like to work at courtsey I
think at court see you could be joining
a team of the most genuine ambitious and
driven people that I've ever met and we
focus not only on helping art the
scientist but also helping each other
succeed so come join us you know we're
located h HQ in palo alto if you like
the sunny California weather but if you
like breweries and cheaper rent
we also offer remote positions so you
could be working in Portland or if you
want to be like the stock photo and code
in a suit or take a month off in or not
off but spend the month in Maui you know
we have those remote opportunities as
well
so all coming together we have science
people and remote opportunities
[Applause]
alright hey everybody
so we're reach labs and reach Labs is
long-range wireless electricity but
that's actually useful so we're able to
provide a reliable source of power to
any enabled device without a physical
tether and the reason that we're
building this is not only to augment you
know current devices charge cell phones
charge robots etc but more to enable
applications that couldn't exist without
this technology and we'd be willing to
talk more about that become say hi to us
so the fun part is sort of how we do it
and we use high dimensional adaptive
antenna arrays wrapped with a lot of
nonlinear optimization algorithmic
control to pinpoint devices and a power
network with radio transmission so we're
able to send energy through the air just
in the same way that Wi-Fi sends data
you know we're founded out of MIT so
we're kind of nerds for research one of
the big things that we really like to do
is you know scrape the world of
electromagnetic research optimization
research and incorporate that into our
core products so our initial
applications are actually unfortunately
not to charge your cell phones but are
rather focused on need to have
applications which arrives most often in
the industrial sector so that's you know
IOT sensors autonomous robotics and then
you know charging a lot of machinery
concurrently company developments we did
just close our Series A with data
collective VC so they're very sort of
top tier high tech firm so we refresh
with funding and we're scaling up to be
able to make our initial deployments and
take on our first clients we've got a
pipeline of clients that are waiting so
all we need is the engineers to help us
integrate like I said we're looking for
talented inspired people people that
like researching fast-paced development
etc we're a very small team there's only
five of us all of us are here so a lot
of people have talked about company
culture I think that our culture is best
demonstrated by our people we work out
of an old cookie factory from 1903 in
Oakland
and if we're nothing if not eclectic so
you can come see us we're all wearing
these shirts and we're nice people
this is what we're hiring for embedded
systems RF Hardware electrical
engineering and software development we
got a demo running so we'd love to chat
with y'all Thanks hello everyone my name
is I'm Jed mossad I'm the co-founder and
CEO of repli'd so 2018 and it still
sucks getting started into programming
it's really hard I mean we're all
engineers anyone here just loves sending
up the development environment like
that's something they're looking forward
to so what one person our back don't
come work for us but it's still really
hard so like imagine if there's a way to
get started with programming in just two
seconds an online IDE with zero setup a
full-featured IDE you'll have things
like code intelligence as your coding
you'll you'll see suggestions and it's
full-blown code intelligence for most of
the languages that we support and we
support 40 programming languages also
live deployment the moment you open a
port and R applet you just deploy your
app that's how easy it is to deploy apps
there's a lot more I know people are
talking a lot but I thought the
presentation was only 90 seconds so I
didn't put all the features which will
take me an hour to to get through but
you know if you like this kind of stuff
if you like building tools if you're a
hacker you know our mission is to get
the next billion programmers online and
we're only 0.1% of the way there you do
the math so fun and challenging problems
we're working on container orchestration
system on the back end should be two
file system and we're building the
world's fastest IDE so come talk to me
afterwards Thanks
[Applause]
hey i'm david and we're retool retool is
a dramatically faster way of building
custom internal tools so let's say your
youtube and somebody's uploaded a really
dodgy video you want to be able to
approve or reject that video that's an
example of a custom internal tool our
insight is that all custom internal
tools all have the exact same building
blocks like tables buttons and etc and
so retool gives you all these building
blocks so you can drag-and-drop and mix
and match them together and build any
custom internal tool you might want
that's much faster than building it from
scratch every single time and the market
is huge 50% of all code written goes
towards internal tools that might sound
really surprising here in Silicon Valley
but that's because our job is to write
code for other people if you think about
all the companies outside of the valley
like coca-cola all of the code they
write is all purely internal stuff and
so so much code goes towards internal
tools and we can make internal tools so
much faster that's a tremendously
valuable problem we started around a
year ago and we're currently just two
founders so looking for a first engineer
or a profitable over there's a seed
round from the founders of stripe open
AI etc so if you enjoy working on really
hard problems and I want to have a high
impact on the product and engineering
come talk to us after Thanks
[Applause]
hey everyone I'm Alex CEO and founder of
scale our vision is to accelerate the
development of AI applications it's no
secret that deep supervised learning is
training changing the world and the
problem is really that you require a ton
of data to build supervised deep
learning Google's internal Street View
data set was more than 2 billion images
for a sense of scale what's really
interesting is with supervised deep
learning in particular you have a new
way to improve your software and that's
labeling ground truth data so it turns
out that for most of these production
use cases labeling ground truth data is
the biggest ball neck for ultimately
building incredible applications so what
we've built is an end-to-end API driven
platform for getting ground truth data
we've only been around for two years but
we've already become the standard for
ground truth data in the self-driving
car in computer vision industries we
work with almost every us-based
self-driving company including companies
like cruise zooks lift as well as tech
giants like Pinterest and Airbnb the
real challenge that we have is using AI
and great user experience to make humans
very efficient at this task of labeling
there's no better place than scale to
work on problems like active learning
and semi-supervised learning to make the
process of getting tons of high-quality
ground truth data very efficiently our
team is really really incredible we just
wrote a blog post that shows everyone's
backgrounds that you can read about they
hail from companies like open AI Google
Dropbox Facebook cruise etc we have two
gold medalists on our team so I I'm very
proud of the team that we've built it's
about 30 people right now and then we're
a series B company we've been invested
in by accel Index Ventures as well as
drew Houston and Greg Brockman so we're
building the AWS for AI data labeling is
just our first product and
really sort of building the shovels in
the gold rush of AI thank you hello
everyone I'm Dan Knox and one of the
founders of science exchange science
exchange is a marketplace for scientific
collaboration or as The Economist put it
where Ober for experiments so core
product is a online platform enterprise
platform that is used by scientists at
thousands of the world's top R&D
organizations like the one shown here
the life sciences aerospace consumer
products and others we have true product
market fit
since raising our Series C last year
we've tripled our revenue and it's a
really exciting time for the company
things are really taking off so a lot of
great companies presenting here today
why should you think about joining
science exchange so let's run through a
couple of reasons so first we're a truly
mission driven company our mission is an
important one
to improve the quality and efficiency of
scientific research and it's the heart
of everything we do second we're still a
smallish team for a Serie C company
there's about 80 of us so far eight zero
with twenty across product and
engineering so it's a scale wire you
know scale wise it's a great time to
join the company because it's still a
time we can make a big impact on the
company's success and there's still a
lot of upside third we have a
collaborative engineering culture it's a
supportive environment that really
supports rapid skills development career
growth and has a true ownership
mentality fourth we have a diverse team
we truly value diversity and inclusion
for instance team currently has a 50/50
gender split we have a female CEO my
co-founder Elizabeth and a female VP of
engineering and fourth fifth downtown
Palo Alto we have an office just off
University Avenue short walk from the
Caltrain and about to move into a ball
and use space
to accommodate our growth there you go
five reasons to think about joining
science exchange you can learn more in
our careers page
come see me dear B or Shawn afterwards
thanks so much
[Applause]
hello everybody don't fall asleep on me
okay
I'm Luciano I'm the CTO and co-founder
of scope AI or NLP powered analytics
platform for customer conversations so
today companies received thousands of
unstructured customer feedback every day
and they spend hours manually tagging it
to be able to create reports and
presentations for their companies we
automate the entire process which is why
they love us
anybody can log in right now and find
out what a customer saying about any
topic and how they feel about it how do
we do this we plug in directly to all
the sources we extract valuable data
from the text and then we build one of
the world's only text based analytics
Suites to be able to explore that data
what's extraction looks like so it's
easy to find out in the text that
somebody said cancel but what's hard is
figuring out why that's a cancel and we
use things like semantic role labeling a
dependency parsing to decipher what
customers are saying how they feel about
certain things on the analytics suite
we're building one of the only
text-based analytics platform so you'll
be building trending or trending methods
and anomaly detection methods for text
as well as predictive models so what's
gonna happen in December you'll be
building visualizations for text that go
way beyond say word clouds but it's even
bigger than that so we have a customer
feedback we ingest the business actions
and we ingest the financial metrics and
that allows us to automate
decision-making for companies why you
know what customers are saying you know
what happened when they said that and
you know what you did to remedy a
situation so you know next time what you
have to do like a door - team said we're
good people okay so come talk to us
I met my co-founder Harvard we have an
amazing set of X linked in X Google
employees if you're excited about NLP if
you're excited about ml and production
if you excited about data especially
textual data come shop with us
I'm easy to make laughs so if you want
to come tell me jokes I'm also great at
that but yeah if you're excited about
you know really being able to listen to
customers and any be able to map that
the decision-making
please come chat with us thank you
[Applause]
oops hi everybody I'm clam from shown
and as shown we are bringing autonomous
cargo ships to market as I'm sure you
all know autonomy is happening
everywhere in cars trikes drones yet
today cargo ships are still operated
raining efficiently by a crew of 25
people so our solution that shown is to
retrofit existing ships with autonomous
technology to bring that number down
from 25 to 15 so we've started about a
year ago and at that time we didn't have
access to a cargo ship mainly because
they cost 100 million dollar-plus
so we bought a small boat like this one
and retrofitted it to prove autonomy
since then we've done a lot of work
we've been through ways here at the
beginning of the year we've raised the
four million sit round and we have a
pilot going on with the third biggest
shipping line in the world and that
allows us to have technology installed
on three of their cargo ships operating
between the u.s. west coast and China in
the same at the same time we've run from
three founders coming from self-driving
and drones to a team diversity of nine
people including seven engineers and we
are looking for many more talented
people like you to help us by creating
intelligent algorithms to understand
what's happening around the ships but
also communicate and information to the
crew in a sensible way and also make the
traumatic decisions based on that you
know in order for the ships to be
autonomous we also have a ton of data
every week we collect over a terabyte of
data for every ship we have and finally
we need people who can understand how
all of the systems on a ship work and
help us to integrate on new ships as
well growing so thank you very much
come talk to us
[Applause]
hey guys my name is Stefan and I'm the
CEO and co-founder of starsky robotics
and we're making driverless trucks so
some of you might know this some of you
probably don't but the biggest problem
in North American logistics is that it's
really really hard to get a person to
spend a month at a time in a truck
the reason it's it's such a big problem
that even though it pays sixty to ninety
thousand dollars a year without a high
school diploma there's still a shortage
of fifty thousand drivers so the problem
here is not make something autonomous
the problem is make trucks drive without
people at them and that's what we're
doing we're making trucks autonomous on
the highway where autonomy is easiest
but teleoperated for the first and last
mile is gonna stop there we go
um so what you're gonna see here is one
of our trucks driving down the road in
Florida with no person sitting behind
the wheel the telly operator comfortably
sitting in air conditioning a hundred
miles away issues high-level controls
like changing lanes changing speed the
types of context based decisions that
humans are great at and robots are
really hard to teach we're gonna take
we're gonna take people out of the truck
and haul Freight with them on a regular
basis this year but we need help our
core products built on top of Ross with
with C++ and Python we're looking for
machine learning people with experience
and things like tensorflow and cafe we
need a lot of help with controls people
with experience with linear and
nonlinear controllers but then we're
also looking for full stack engineers
data engineers and all sorts of other
roles there's a it's really easy to
apply for us you can just go to starsky
dot io and and apply right now on your
phone or on your laptop
we're starsky robotics we're doing
driverless trucks
[Applause]
hello welcome to YC so my name is Joe
I'm the founder of a company called
universe universe is an app that lets
you make an awesome website from your
phone well there are plenty of website
builders out there this is the only one
designed from the ground up for phones
here's how it works
your canvas is a grid on the grid sit
blocks a block could be anything you
want to put on your website whether it's
a an image or a song and you move these
around like Lego put them and do
whatever you want with them the things
people are creating are incredible
diversity is absolutely staggering it's
inspiring and it's working we were part
of ycs winter batch this past year we
hit 175,000 sites created and we just
closed our series a a 4 million dollar
round by some of the best investors in
the valley including General Catalyst
and javelin partners so now we're
growing we are looking for an iOS
engineer someone who loves building
incredible experiences and wants to help
us make our app even better this is a
roll who open to anybody anywhere we are
a distributed company we don't have a
stocked kitchen with free snacks but we
give you freedom and we give you purpose
this is about
check we believe that everybody should
build the Internet not just people like
us and we build tools to empower
everybody to do that we're looking for
our sixth member we're looking for
people who are self driven whip-smart
and want to be part of something amazing
so find us in the black t-shirts
[Applause]
hi my name is Hannon I'm a co-founder at
bland C we build and operate long-range
high payload drones we started back in
2015 we are based in San Francisco and
were backed by some of the most
prominent Silicon Valley VCS
I know what you're thinking I had the
exact same thought when I started a
company drone deliveries isn't Amazon
doing that well first of all the answer
is no second we're not planning to
deliver your toothbrush to your backyard
using drones we help deliver critical
supplies to our enterprise customers in
need of a spare part and we help deliver
medical supplies to hard-to-reach areas
affected by a natural disaster we also
do some super complicated cool stuff
like landing a 15-foot drone on a moving
vessel in the middle of the ocean to
enable ship to shore deliveries and vice
versa we are super experienced smart
team of 20 people spread across multiple
groups and we are looking to hire more
people for our production and our D
teams if you're looking for your next
challenge come speak to us after this
presentation thank you
[Applause]
how's it going I am max I am one of the
cofounders of volley and we make
voice-controlled games for Alexa and
Google home so what is a
voice-controlled game I got a couple
examples for you here the left one yes
sire
basically choose your own adventure
interactive fiction set in medieval
times kind of like those old books
probably some of you used to read the
other ones song quiz is sort of a name
that tune music trivia game where we
play short clips of pop music and you
try to name the title or the artist and
that one actually is the number one game
on Alexa which is pretty cool so why
join volley three big reasons I think
one is reach the second is cool
up-and-coming technology and the third
look we literally make fun so first
thank you Jed we have a number one game
on Alexa we have over half a million
monthly active players and growing and
just a small team of eight full-time
employees supporting that Alexa and
Google home are exploding there are over
50 million devices sold last year and
that's gonna double or triple again this
year technology is the future look we
make voice controlled software it's
pretty cool we work on speech
recognition natural language processing
and we do it all on top of a service AWS
lamda stack we also get cool sort of
early access to Amazon and Google
technology so if you want beta programs
and you kind of want to know what those
companies are up to
we're the first ones to do it on voice
finally as I said we literally make fun
I mean my job is to bring joy into
people's lives every day and yours could
be too I think it's a pretty cool
opportunity and you know gets me up
every day to go to work so we are volley
we make games for Alexa and Google home
we have a number one game on the Alexus
store we're working on up-and-coming
technologies and look I mean if you want
to get up every day and entertain people
come find us afterwards thank you
[Applause]
alright hey everyone I'm Brandon
Leonardo one of the founders of
instacart we do same-day grocery
delivery it's actually kind of weird
like six years ago is three of us in a
building over there and and now here we
are and we sell billions of dollars a
year in groceries and we do millions of
deliveries a month and we've got a team
of about 150 engineers about 500 all in
that are helping us do that our
objective over the next few years is
really to be the world leader in online
groceries and our primary like you know
goal and that is to build a team to win
and that's something that's inclusive of
our shoppers so we've got tens of
thousands of shoppers out in the field
shopping every day and we're gonna need
you know hundreds of thousands over the
next year to achieve our goals and that
also means you know we're about a team
of 150 right now we're hiring about
another 200 over the next 12 to 15
months so that's where you come in I
think when you think about like where
you want to work next there's a couple
questions that like people seem to care
about one of them is culture so I
thought I'd touch really briefly on that
and I'm wearing this shirt that you
can't see but it says solve for the
customer which is our primary cultural
value and at the end of the day the
customer is placing their order on
instacart getting the groceries
delivered is our North Star and we're
very like customer focused company
that's something that matters a lot to
us and then as far as challenges and
engineering problems and things that we
need to work on you throw a dart and you
can hit one you know the things that
keep me up at night
are new more numerous and we have
scaling problems we're growing faster
now than we were a year ago we've
actually doubled our growth rate in the
last year which is insane if you know
that's like a completely magical
experience our team is still pretty
small I think that individually you can
have a huge impact on the trajectory of
the company I think that you can have a
huge impact on your own growth and your
own learning your own success so I would
say come join us come ask us questions
about the rest of our cultural values
and the things that we care about come
out
there's questions about the rest of our
engineering challenges we've got James
over there
who's on the catalog team and Michael
who Lee's recruiting and I'm also last
so thank you so much for your time and
thank you for hearing us how
[Applause]
you
