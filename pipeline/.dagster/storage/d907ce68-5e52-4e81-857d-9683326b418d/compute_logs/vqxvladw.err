answer.

This video is about why people try to do shared leadership, and how you can tell if you should be CEO or not. It might
seem like its not important... but it is.

Since this video was created, we've launched [YC Co-Founder Matching](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching).
The advice in this video is still correct -- if you have an existing network to search for co-founders, that's a great
place to look for a match. But many founders have also found success with our co-founder matching service, so we now
recommend you try that in parallel.

YC Partner Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup. This lecture was filmed for
the future founder track of Startup School 2020.
