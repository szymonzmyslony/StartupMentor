Because YC invests in startups so early, I've spent a lot of time with people who aren't yet sure if they should start a company or not. I've helped many people, including my own friends and family, think about this decision and my intended audience for this talk is anyone who doesn't feel ready to start a startup today, but thinks they may want to one day in the future.

I'm gonna break down the topic of whether you should start a startup into two parts. First, we'll talk about which types of people seem best suited to being startup founders and help you figure out if you might be one of them. Second, we'll talk about how you might best prepare yourself for becoming a startup founder in the future.

Let's start by helping you figure out if you are the kind of person who should become a startup founder or not. I really wish there were a simple test you could take that would give you a clear and correct answer to that question. I've now worked with almost a thousand startup founders as a group partner at YC, and I still get surprised by which people take to startup life like a duck to water and which ones struggle to adapt. Now, you might find this surprising if your image of startups is based on the way famous founders are often depicted in books or movies. These depictions can make it seem that if you're not a ruthless, brilliant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network movie, or a charismatic product genius like Steve Jobs in one of the many books or movies about him, you probably aren't cut out to be a startup founder.
Now, I can't deny that being a brilliant programmer or a charismatic product genius will certainly make it easier to be a successful startup founder. But I can say that after working with many successful founders, there are many more different types of people who succeed at startups with different strengths than just those stereotypes.

As an investor, my job is to pick which people will make great startup founders. And yet, even after 15 years of starting and investing in startups, I still get surprised by who turns out to be a great startup founder. That means it's gonna be hard for you to know for sure if you are suited to being one. You might think you could just look at how well someone has done in school or at work and assume success there will lead to success at startups. That's definitely what I thought when I first started working at YC in 2010 and began reading YC funding applications for the first time. After I started working with more startups, though, I realized that these signals mattered much less than I'd expected they would.

When you're working on a startup, you have to put in blood, sweat, and tears to convince even a single user to care about trying your product, let alone convincing the first 10 or a hundred. You have to push through a lot of rejection to get there, and because this is your startup all of that rejection feels very personal in a way it doesn't, when you're working at a fan company, building a product for someone else. It takes a lot of resilience to make it through this initial struggle to get your early users, and that's the quality I think is most important for startup founders to have.

Resilient people are suited to startups and should definitely become founders, but how do you know if you have enough resilience to be a startup founder? When I first started working at YC, I thought I could use confidence as a proxy for resilience. I'd assume that if someone projected confidence, like speaking with conviction, being high energy during our funding interviews, they were likely to be a resilient founder. The more founders I worked with though, the more I realized this was also wrong. It turned out that someone could appear very confident initially, but not be resilient when their startup hit roadblocks. Conversely, some of the quietest and least confident seeming founders at first turned out to be the most resilient founders I'd go on to work with, many, eventually taking their companies public.

This is Sajith, the founder of Benchling. I met him when we funded Benchling in 2012. Benchling is now worth over $6 billion, and Sajith has grown into a formidable founder and CEO. But I remember when we first interviewed him and his co-founder Cory. They were both softly spoken engineers and we were all concerned they wouldn't be suited to working on Benchling because Benchling's idea was to sell software to biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies to make money, and we weren't sure that they would be good at that kind of enterprise sales. This concern was shared by investors at demo day, who worried that they wouldn't be able to get those biotech or pharmaceutical companies to pay for the Benchling software. And Benchling struggled to raise very much seed funding at demo day. Sales did turn out to be a real struggle for Benchling. In fact, over a year after they'd graduated from YC, Benchling was still not making any revenue, though they did have some enthusiastic grad students as free users, and the product continued getting better. It took them almost another year - that's now two years after YC - to start doing sales and making any revenue. Now, Benchling is on course to become a public company someday and has many of the world's top biotech and pharmaceutical companies as customers. Looking back, I always had confidence that Sajith was a good engineer. But I could not have predicted back when we funded him in 2012, that he would have the resilience to overcome that amount of rejection and transform himself into the leader of a company that took many years to become great at enterprise sales.

But what I haven't shared with you are the stories of many other founders who seemed equally talented at first when we first funded their companies, but turned out not to have the same amount of resilience as these founders did. I've thought a lot about how to tell the difference between people who have this kind of startup resilience and those who don't.

I've wondered if maybe having the right motivations or reasons to start a company mean you're more likely to have this special resilience. Over time, though, I've decided that this also doesn't matter as much as I had thought. I think there are many perfectly legitimate motivations to start a company.

For example, it's become popular to say that you shouldn't start a company just to make money. That's considered a somewhat flimsy motivation, but I actually think it's fine to start a startup to become rich. Startups are one of the few ways to make life changing amounts of money in a relatively short period of time.

If the desire to make money gets you started, then great. Go for it. I also think that simply being curious about what it's like to found a startup is a fine initial motivation to start one. Actually doing a startup is the only way to know for sure if you'll enjoy it. The reason I have conviction that your initial motivations don't matter so much is that I've seen motivations change over time.

I've seen founders who started out a company with a plan to sell it within a year changed their mind as they kept working with the company and are still working on that same startup a decade later, and it's now a public company. This means that your initial motivations to start a startup aren't as important as what those motivations might change into over time. In order to keep working on a startup and keep going through those dark periods that every startup experiences, you need enduring motivations, and I think the best ones are to be genuinely interested in the problem you're working on and love the people you're working with. We'll talk more about finding those later.

So instead of introspecting too much on, if you'll make a good startup founder, I'll offer some practical advice. If you are curious about what it'd be like to start a company, start by asking yourself, What do I have to lose? Now, I mean this question, not as a rhetorical one, but as a very practical one. Figure out what the worst case scenario looks like if you started a startup and decide if you can live with that. It's probably gonna take at least a year for you to have enough data to tell if the startup you're working on is promising enough to keep working on. In the worst case, you'll shut down the company without having earned much or any salary for that year. Can you live with that worst case? The calculus here is different for everyone. If you're about to graduate college, taking a year after graduating to work on a startup is not a big deal. Those job offers will still be waiting for you in a year, but if you've been a FAANG employee for the past nine years and you're in line for a big promotion this year, then maybe you stand to lose a lot by spending the next year working on a startup instead. Asking yourself if you can handle the worst case is the best way to know if you should start a startup. Be honest with yourself. If you can't actually handle the worst case, then your own constant anxiety will probably self-sabotage your startup efforts.

When you're thinking about the worst case scenario of working on a startup, you should factor something else into the equation. You will learn a lot from starting a company. I don't think enough people factor in how valuable this learning is when they're doing their worst case scenario analysis. As a startup founder, you are responsible for making everything happen, and that means you get to do lots of different types of work. You'll have to do some amount of sales, product and customer support all at once. This can be very clarifying in helping you figure out what type of work you enjoy and where you might want to focus your career, even if the startup doesn't work out. Some people start a company that doesn't work, and then they jump straight back into starting another one because they wanna learn from their mistakes. Others decide they actually really enjoy specializing in doing one thing really well, and they join a company where they can do just that. The startup experience can really improve your career opportunities, even if the startup doesn't succeed.

My second startup, Triplebyte, used software to help companies identify and hire great people. I work with hundreds of employers as they search for the best talent, and I found that many of them were explicitly looking to hire people who had previous startup experience. They believed they showed evidence of being a self-starter and being able to take initiative and lead projects. Some of the most successful YC companies have actually built their hiring processes around this knowledge.

Rippling a $10 billion company founded by Parker Conrad, also a YC company, hires former founders and puts them in charge of entire product divisions. "Usually we love hiring former founders to run specific product lines and, and build them and, and really run them as general managers. We've been, you know, really successful at recruiting. I think we have now probably around 50 former founders that work at Rippling." At YC, we often see startup founders leave their startup if it doesn't work out and go on to join a more successful YC company.

This is Nick Grandy. YC funded his first startup Wundrbar in 2008. That startup shut down, but he went on to join another YC company you may have heard of, Airbnb, as its first employee. That, of course, worked out great. After many years at Airbnb, he left to start another YC company, Outschool, which is now valued at over $3 billion.

Okay, so let's say you do decide you can live with the worst case of doing a startup, but you're not ready to do one right now. How can you best prepare yourself to start one in the future? To actually start a company you'll want two things, an idea and a co-founder. Now, sometimes an idea and co-founder both come to you quickly and you're off to the races.

There's lots of great startup content out there about how to start a company once you're ready, but let's talk about what to do if it'll take you some time to get to that point. I'd start by encouraging you to not think of finding ideas and co-founders as two separate tasks. It's hard to think up good ideas yourself. Also, your ideas will start out being vague and fuzzy, more like a hunch or an impulse than a clearly formed idea, and you'll go through seven iterations of fleshing it out into something more tangible and concrete. Having someone to talk through that initial idea or impulse with and debate and discuss is important, and the best person to do that with is your co-founder. I find my best ideas come to me during conversations with smart people, so I'd start by thinking about who do you know that you enjoy talking about ideas with? In college, these are often the people you'll go to when you're stuck on a hard problem, or they're the people you most enjoy working on group assignments with. At work, these are the colleagues who you find make you the most productive and help you do your best work. I'd seek these people out and start having conversations with them about ideas or technologies that you find interesting. Talk about products you use every day that you admire or are frustrated by. Talk about technologies you think are underrated today and why.
Flesh your thoughts out and debate them. Spend the time between these conversations, doing your own reading and research to learn more about the topics you find interesting. If you're a curious person, this will seem natural to you anyway. All of this primes your mind to more easily notice and think of potential startup ideas, and it helps you get to know your friends or colleagues better as potential co-founders.
If you are struggling to think of people you enjoy talking about ideas with, then you probably need to change your environment and meet some new people. If you really wanna start a company one day, it's best to choose an environment where you'll be around many people who might someday be your co-founder.
I think the best environment for this is working at a startup. You both get to see how a startup works from the inside, and your colleagues will be less risk averse than the average FAANG employee.

So, if you're in college, I'd recommend finding a startup to work at after graduation, or if you're at a FAANG company now, think about leaving to join a startup as an intermediate step to starting your own someday.
Once you're around smart people who you enjoy talking about ideas with, I'd recommend you start experimenting with turning these ideas into side projects. At some point during these conversations, you'll eventually say something like,' Huh, like, it'd be cool if someone built X', and that's the moment to stop and think about how you could be the one to build X. Is there a simple first version you could build over a weekend? Or can you find other people who might be users and pitch them on the idea to see how they react? Keep pulling on this thread until you've come up with a plan to turn this idea into something real, however small it is. Right now, you're not trying to launch the next unicorn. You're just getting used to the experience of turning ideas into reality and experiencing the thrill of launching something.

To turn your idea into something real, you'll need the skills to actually build them. If you're not a programmer, then either you'll need to learn how to program or find a co-founder who is a programmer. My advice, speaking from experience as someone who started his first startup without being able to code, is start learning to code. You only need to learn enough to build a version one of your ideas.

Once you're around smart people, and you're working on some side projects, how do you know when it's time to take the leap and quit your job to start a company? While it'd be great if one of your side projects started getting explosive traction and made the decision easy for you, you can't rely on that happening if you're serious about starting a company someday. Even if you launch your side projects and get some early users, the feedback you get will be mixed. It's not uncommon for the early users of any product to span the spectrum of being delighted, appalled, and indifferent towards a product. To judge how promising your side project is as a startup idea, I'd use some advice from my Y Combinator partner, Paul Buchheit. He says that it's better to make a product that a few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards. If your side project elicits a deep reaction from someone, the kind where they can legitimately say that doing something very differently as a result of your product existing, then you may be onto something. A single passionate user of a crude prototype that was hacked together on a weekend means so much more than a million signups on a wait list for something that doesn't exist yet.

Description: YC Group Partner Harj Taggar shares his advice on the types of people best suited to be startup founders and how to prepare to start a company in the future.

My main advice to you would be to think less about how well your side projects are going, and think more about how much you're enjoying the process of thinking up ideas and turning them into something real.
Are you learning new things and finding yourself energized? Contrast this feeling with your day job. If you find your job is draining, but you have energy to work on your side projects on evenings and weekends, that's a sign it may be time to quit and work on your own ideas. Pay particular attention to how much you enjoy working with your side project collaborators. If you enjoy working with them and you both want to be startup founders, recognize how rare that is. Having a great co-founder who wants to do a startup is a fantastic reason to quit and start one. To finish, my advice is: one, don't worry too much about your initial motivations or reasons to start a company. Those can change over time. Simply being curious about the experience of starting a startup is enough to get going. Think about the worst case scenario if you did start a company and be sure you can live with that. If you don't yet have an idea or co-founder, start looking around for smart people to talk about ideas with and launch some side projects with. Actually launch those side projects, however small, to get the experience of turning ideas into reality.

Content: 
So, a quick recap. In the first part, I basically say a startup idea is a hypothesis for why your company is gonna grow really quickly. That hypothesis must compose of three different parts: the problem, the solution, and insight. And the basic parts is your problem should be pretty big, pretty pervasive, have a lot of these characteristics to make it feel like there's a very big market that a lot people have the problem. Don't think you need to know about the solution is that you should not start with a technology, you should start with a problem. And lastly, you're looking to have something that's gonna make your company unique and have some kind of unfair advantage that we call an insight that will show why your company will grow faster than other companies.

That stuff that you'll kind of want to know or keep in mind, but a really good investor will do that on their own. They'll hear what you're talking about and extrapolate.

Basically, we believe for every company that we will interview at YC, we bet there's probably another company that's just as good to them out there but they messed up on the application and we didn't realize it. We didn't invite them. And basically, the reason is because they didn't express their idea clearly. That's it. Like, you might think, "Oh, I didn't show off all that complex stuff about my startup idea and that's why they didn't pick me." And I want you to know, that's not true. And so, the first thing I want you to keep in mind is I do not need you to sell me as a YC partner. Right?

So, average investor, what they do is they talk to you when you tell them about your idea, and it feels like they're poking holes, all the questions they ask about what's all the reasons why this could go wrong? A good investor does it the other way around. They hear what you say and they imagine and they use their optimism and they use knowing that some kind of rare event has to happen for you to become a billion-dollar company and they try to imagine all the those rare events that could possibly happen to you, and then they pitch that path back to you.

And so, we are really good at selling ourselves. So, you don't need to do that. And the thing is, you guys are kind of bad at selling things in the beginning, right? And what I need you to understand is that I'm trying to evaluate these three statements when I'm hearing your idea. Do I understand it? Am I excited by it? Do I like the team and do I wanna work with them?

And what I mean by that is that the best companies in YC, or around the world, grow organically, they grow by word of mouth. What does word of mouth look like? It looks like this. It's basically, I talk about your company, what you're doing, making, etc. and I'm the most interesting person at the dinner table. And I tell it to other people, and those people wanna tell other people. That's it. Word of mouth is something where I remember what you do, I talk about it enthusiastic, and it spreads on its own. Marketing and advertising, it's a tax I believe companies pay because they did not make something remarkable.

Now, before anyone can remember at the dinner table what you do, they have to understand. And so, I have very simple rules for how to make things easy to understand. This will sound familiar if you're familiar with an essay I wrote on "How to Design a Better Pitch Deck." And I'm gonna focus on basically saying that the way I talk about designing a pitch deck actually works for ideas and lots of other things. And so, the way I make things easy to understand on a pitch deck or a slide is to make it legible, to make it simple, and make it obvious.

In today's presentation, we're just gonna focus on making your idea legible. It's gonna sound interesting, right? For clarity. Now, in my essay, I talked about how at demo day, when our startups are presenting to a roomful of 1,000 investors, it's kind of an interesting audience. Number one, the audience is filled with really old people, they tend to not have very good eyesight as a result, they all can't sit in the front row like you lovely people. Some of them have to sit in a way back and stand up. And that means if you create a legible slide, they have to be ones that even old people in the back row with bad eyesight can read.

Now, how does that apply to a legible idea? Well, basically, you are designing a slide that democratizes the idea, right? And so people who are blind or people who are ignorant, you're basically designing something for everyone in the room, not just the ones in the first row. So, a legible idea can be understood by people who know nothing about your business. That will make things very clear to the widest possible audience. Now, this is super important because you will talk about your company more than anything else. It is actually the thing that we are really great at Y Combinator. We have our companies constantly practice talking about their startup.

Here are things to avoid that makes things not clear, that makes your idea muddy. The first is ambiguity, right? So, that's like, obviously, the opposite of clear or straightforward.

Complexity. So, I've a very specific definition of complexity. And so, if you look at the root word, simple and complex come from the same root and having to do with twists or braids. Things that are simple are ones that have one braid and things that are complex have multiple braids. They're intertwined with one another. A simple idea is one idea that does not fold. A complex idea are ideas that are intertwined. So, simplicity means you are not trying to mix a bunch of things in your description.

Mystery. So, this is an odd one. Well, what I mean is anything where it's like, I'm not gonna understand what is going on when you're talking about your company. Jargon is one, obviously, any words that I don't understand, anything that's fake like indefinite pronouns. So, if you just use this, etc., and you don't describe what those nouns are, and then things that you just suggest, but aren't explicit about.

And the last is ignorable. And so, what I mean by that is there's some language that we will just ignore. So, in UX design, people will create a sort of blindness to things that they don't wanna look at or they don't find to be of important value. So, for example, ad blindness is a big one that people sort of understand. And the thing is, when you're talking about ideas, there's a way of using language that is also easily ignorable, things that just won't stick in your head.

Things like marketing speak. It's probably lots of stuff that you heard about that, MBA speak, where you kind of like, puff yourself up, talk that doesn't give any extra information, and then buzzwords. And so, when you say certain types of words, that as an investor I've heard over and over again or I will equate with zero information or value, then I will ignore them. And the result is parts of your pitch will end up being not even heard by me, and therefore I will not remember them.

What you wanna do is be conversational. A great pitch is one where you can tell it to your mom and she gets it. She's proud of you, right? She's not gonna shake her head. And that means it's got to be conversational. And that's really good for word of mouth because we talk in normal conversational speak. We don't talk like an MBA. We don't talk like CEOs all the time. So, it's best to talk conversationally.

And the last one, this one's a big one, it's being reproducible. So, when I hear your idea, can I imagine it in my mind? Can I see what I would have to build to create your company? If I don't have that, then I have no picture in my head about what your company does. And until I have that picture, I can't ask any of the questions that helps me understand, if I'm excited about you or understand other nuances of your business. To make things reproducible, I need to know nouns. I need to have objects that I'm gonna imagine in my head.

So, let's go through some examples. This says, we are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information. This sucks. The thing is, we see this all the time. Number one, all the nouns that you see down here are abstract. They're ideas. I can't reproduce based off of this, has zero informational value. I still have to ask questions to answer the three nouns that I need to have. This is a bad description for a company.

Here's Dropbox. Synchronizes files across your or your team's computers. The thing about this is it's refreshing but also there's no pretense. They aren't playing defense. I see a lot of company descriptions where they're like, "I'm worried about this, or I've gotten this kind of feedback." And so, they give up clarity to make themselves look bigger and blow themselves up or make themselves try to look more interesting. They're trying to protect themselves against something way ahead of time. And the whole problem is usually what ends up doing is it brings me farther away from you, all that padding that you've put on yourself.

Here's a description from a company in the current batch. Lumineye is building X-ray vision for soldiers and first responders. We don't have to go deep into the details. I don't need to understand how they exactly do this, etc. This creates a foundation for my curiosity. Now, I will start from here to try to figure out, "Oh, how do you do this? Is this the right team to do this? How far along are they? Do they have traction? Do they have customers?" I start going down the route of asking all the right questions based off this one description. This is a good one.

I'm excited about someone building the LinkedIn and I know it's some kind of social network for business people. And so, now I'm curious about how. I don't need you to answer how in the description, but I understand what you're doing. And then, now, I can start making questions in my head about like, how would I evaluate whether this is working or successful or promising or not? Or is this the right team?

Now, the reason I've used this example is because we have a lot of companies who try to use the X for Y. And what I mean by that is like LinkedIn for whatever or Uber for blank or Airbnb for blank. And so, that X for Y is super useful because it allows you to shortcut business model and some kind of complex behavior, right? And then attach it to some other vertical or something that you're trying to make work. X for Y is okay but most people abuse it or do it incorrectly. So, I'm gonna give you some tips.

First, should you use X for Y? Sorry for the legibility. Number one, is X a household name? This should be like a billion-dollar company, right? You can't use your uncle's like pet shoe store as the X for this because people don't know your uncle's pet shoe store and they don't know if it's successful or not, right? So, everyone, as many people should know about this as possible, and for an investor, it should be clear that it's a billion-dollar-company opportunity. Everyone has to agree that it is successful. So, you could have a really big X everyone knows about it but it's infamous, right? So, a lot of people don't think it's successful. So, be careful of that.

Does Y want X? So, is it really clear why the target that you're going after wants this kind of model applied to it, this kind of solution applied to it? Whether it's Airbnb for, Airbnb, or Uber for, etc. It should be really clear that that's a segment that's either missing it, it's not being served well by the other one, and also that those people want to have that kind of model.

And then third one is Y should be a huge market? So, if you're building X for Y and in the last part doesn't sound like a really big business, that's not gonna work well for you, right? Because what we want, because you're essentially saying that you are something but it's a subset. And what we want to make sure is that subset feels like it could be really, really big. If you choose the subset that sounds like it's going to be really, really small, investors won't be as interested. It means that I'm worried that you will not have enough potential headroom to grow to become a billion-dollar company.

All right, so basic summary for this section. Lead with what not why or how. You don't need all that other stuff, that stuff gets in the way of your clarity for the most part. I read that like 1,000 applications every single batch and it's a really hard thing to do.

What we don't want is me to go like, "I don't know what they're talking about." Then I have to like, go to your website, I'm like, "I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know how that sort of works." I go back to it, I try to figure something else out, I try to see if like some other partner might understand what you're doing, etc. Super inefficient.

Content: 
So, to be efficient, we need to be concise. Concise. The best way, I wanna keep this in mind, is to use some examples. And so, here's some things I need you to keep in mind. Yes, I want you to be concise, use as few words as possible. And what I want you to understand is the concision, it actually gives me secondary information about you as a team. It lets me one, know that you've thought deeply about your idea. Because you've thought so deeply about it and because you've practiced talking about it so much, and you've gotten really good at getting people excited and understand your thing really quickly, you probably figured out how to do it in a short amount of time. So, it lets me know that this is a founder that has thought deeply about the idea.

The other thing about being concise, it shows me that you are efficient. And if you're efficient with your words, then you're probably efficient with your thoughts, and that means you're probably also efficient with your actions. And what that means is that I will start to believe that you understand what is most important about your business, you understand and communicate it clearly. And you might actually know how to always figure out the most important part of what to do about your company to make it grow, to make it work, etc.

So, there's a minimum stuff that we want to have, even though we're trying to be as concise as possible. Again, I wanna understand the nouns. So, if we're so concise, that I can't understand these, then your concision is too much. The other is, I want to get to this point, when I read the concision or this short version of whatever it is you're talking about, because again, I know there's like 100,000 reasons why your company is great, but when I'm reading your application, I'm only going to maybe remember two to three of them. And so we have to try to make sure those most important ones come up to the top.

This is a real Startup School company description. It's an online ecommerce store. I can picture what it is, but again, it's not a description that helps me get excited about, it doesn't help me lead to all the other things. I have to do now more work to understand why this is fast growing and its potential. I also don't know, based on this, some nouns. I don't know exactly who the customer is. Is it people that are selling stuff too? Are they making an e commerce store for other shop owners? It's ambiguity.

Learn and sharing knowledge about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Sounds more like a mission. I can't tell what the product is,
and how they're sorted and go about it. Like, I couldn't reproduce this. If I had 10 companies build based off this description, you'd have 10 very different products. The only thing that's odd about company descriptions is you guys tend to capitalize and make proper nouns very weird words and phrases. You should not do that. It's not like a magazine title. And it makes me think sometimes you're emphasizing the wrong things. Like you're thinking the data science and artificial intelligence is the thing that's gonna make me excited. And the thing is like, those are the buzzwords, those are the solutions, and it makes me worried that you haven't started with a problem.

Let's do an example of like how to adjust a description. So, here's a much longer one. So, our company will make low cost and low power consumption medical devices based on artificial intelligence and IoT suitable for sub-Saharan communities. Now, relatively clear, I could understand it reading it, but it's not the most concise form of this and I feel like there's a lot of things get in the way. And so, when I work with companies to help shrink and reduce and improve their descriptions so that I will get the most out of it. I wanna talk through the process.

The first thing I wanna do is figure out what are the nouns in the description? Here we go. Our company, medical devices, for sub-Saharan communities. Oh shit, we're almost done, right? Everything else that gets added on here, whatever verb, adjectives or adverbs you want, you wanna be really careful. You wanna know like, is it giving maximum punch for this? Right?

But usually it's going to be whatever the product, like, the verb is like the thing that we're making. If we're thinking about this in an active voice structure, the subject, the verb, and then the object - the customer, the market, the people we're going after.

And then up here, I see two modifiers for medical devices, low cost, low power consumption. So, low cost, I could definitely see, that's super interesting. If you make a low-cost device in sub-Saharan community, then I'm like, "Oh, that's interest. That's really interesting." Because that's, like, it's hard just to make something, you know, for developing countries, but to make it so that actually affordable for them, that'd be interesting. The low power consumption, I can give or take there, I'd have to know more about the company to know whether that's actually crucial to understanding whether this company has an unfair advantage or not.

So, if I was to redo this, we come out to, "We create affordable medical devices for sub-Saharan Africa." Some people are gonna be very squeamish about this. A lot of founders are worried it's like, "You're putting me in a box, man. It's too reductive. My business is complex, I do a lot of things and a lot of things make me great. I wanna tell you all of them." And the thing is, like, you don't have time, and I know it, as an investor. There is no investor that thinks any business is like simple and easy. I just don't think that from the default, so you shouldn't be worried that I'm going to think something small of that.

So let me describe the situation. So, demo day at Y Combinator, it's like 1,000 people in the room, and you have two minutes to talk about your company and show what you've built to get them excited. And then there's gonna be 200 other companies that will do the same thing on the stage. It's an extremely hard problem. And so, in two minutes, what do you get across? How do we get it so that in two minutes, a company on average will then raise $1.5 million after demo day?

And the thing to keep in mind is that, yes, there's 100 reasons why your company is great. You cannot say all of them in two minutes, you can't say them in a short conversation when you're meeting a bunch of investors inside of the room. There's like maybe five to six points that are really, really great about your company, maybe the investor will remember one or two of them. One of them has to be remembering what you do. And so, the goal of you being on stage is not to say all the things that's great about your company, it is to get people to want to have a conversation with you, to say, like, "I can't ignore having a conversation with that person." That's what a great pitch does.

And what that means is, you don't make the slides be the thing that they remember. You wanna make yourself. It's about your presence, the way you talk, how confident you are, etc. Basically, do you present yourself in a way that people go, "I wanna interact with you."? And so, the presentation is more about making the founders look formidable and impressive to use a language that everyone understands and is clear, but feels inevitable. And so, the goal is not to do all this fancy stuff. It is to do very simple fundamentals and talk about them in a way so that everyone will understand. Right there.

Because part of it is that YC is optimized to spend time with lots of people every single week for dinner.

Kevin: Gotcha. So, the question is he's working on a very complex FinTech solution or app. And he's wondering, it's like, how do I balance this talking to the right people so I can use jargon and who understand the complexity versus making a version of the idea that everybody can sort of understand? The answer is you have to do both. So, everyone that you're talking to at industry, your users, customers, or your business partners, you get a shortcut with them. And that's most of the people you're gonna interact with. And the thing to know about that is you need to have that developed, right? That customer or business partner speech so that you're efficient and talking with them.

The thing is, you also have this other one, if you're interested in outside investment, having the press want to talk about you, etc. You need to have a good storytelling narrative for non-experts. So, really, it is not one or the other is how you have to do both. And the thing is for FinTech people, because there's so much around all these other people who just understand this stuff, they rarely practice the other thing, because they just assume it's always going to be like that. But when they come to YC, it's the first time they want money from investors who might not know about their space or they wanna talk to press who's not gonna understand what they're doing, etc. Right here, sitting down.

In the second tier, it's really just like, I'm energized. Because when I'm reading tons of applications, I just don't understand what's going on or I feel like people wasted a lot of time on the wrong stuff. I'm just getting frustrated. Like, when I hit an application where all of a sudden it goes like, "Oh, it's a breath of fresh air." And I like, "I wanna spend time with them, I wanna ask them a bunch of questions, I get very curious and then I like want to jump around the room." I'm a very active guy.

Kevin: Oh, okay, yeah. So, I talked a lot about focusing on the what and then kind of avoid the how and the why, but they might be really important. How do I include them? You will not include them in the description. They will be included elsewhere. So, there's questions on the application that asked you about how are you gonna get your users, what is an insight that you understand about the business no one else does, how you came across this, etc. So, there's opportunities elsewhere.

One thing to keep in mind is, I would highly recommend trying to keep your answers within one to two paragraphs at the most. That makes it for an application that's very skimmable by me. So, the whole thing is the how and why is important, but you can't just say it all at once. Like, sometimes you'd like to talk to someone and they're telling you a story, but they're trying to tell everything about everything all at once. And it feels like he's not giving you time to breathe or think. You wanna sort of avoid that context. Right over there, enthusiastic curly hair.

Kevin: How? That sounds like a together question, but I'll answer it. So, how do you know if a company's on the right path to product-market fit? So, if you have to ask a question, do I have product-market fit? The answer is probably no, you probably don't. Right? But if you're so busy, and you're frightened that the company is gonna fall apart, because you have so many customers coming in asking stuff for you, you're just figuring out how do I hire? How do I serve everyone that wants to come to me? You're too busy to ask that question because you're just making money hand over fist, that's product-market fit, you're on the right path.

Kevin: So I tell a small anecdote about when I applied to YC, and about how this sort of applies. When I applied to Y Combinator, I was really bad at describing what our company does. So, we actually had pitched two different ideas. They told us to prepare for both and when we got into the interview, one of the ideas they immediately said, not interested. And the other idea we needed a pivoting in the middle of the interview.

And so, the way I had described the company, in the beginning, was I said, "We are building a content management system that has a concept called reversible forms that allows you to both put data input in from the back end, and also collect data from users on the front end." That's a horrible description of a company. And part of that idea that fed that is like, I wanted to be a content management system because what was hot at the time, it was buzz, where it was movable type in WordPress. We wanted to build software like that and we wanted to build a new version of this.

And then I added, not even normal jargon, I made up jargon that I put into my description and I pitched it. And Paul Graham was just like, "Oh, no, what are you talking about?" But he was like, "I think you're building a Form Builder." And then we were like, "No, no." We looked at everyone in that space, they suck, they're really bad. We don't like what they're making, we don't want to be there. Not realizing that was the opportunity. Everyone was really bad there but their businesses still succeeded. And so, that's like the clear example of this from like the other side.

Kevin: So, how do you tell and describe an idea that has multiple stages, like you have to do part one, before you can do part two and three. I would focus only on describing what part one is and then later on, you talk about what are the other phases that are important. Now, oftentimes, when I hear something like that, a YC partner will immediately have like an alarm go in their head, and they really are going to push you on. Why do we really have to do part one? I'm gonna push so hard and why can't we go straight to part three. Because what you're basically saying is like...it sounds almost like a defense instead of you saying your strategy.

It sounds like it's like, "Hey, I'm gonna talk about what my company's doing but I'm worried that you're gonna think it's really small. So, don't worry, we're gonna do parts two and three, they're gonna be even bigger."

Content: 
So let's start by talking about why should you have a co-founder at all. Well, I think there's three main reasons you really want a co-founder when you're starting a company. The first is productivity, you can get a lot more work done if you have someone to divide the work up with. And you can get much better work done if you have a co-founder who maybe has complementary skills, so they can do things that you can't. And there's someone you enjoy discussing ideas with. So you can brainstorm and come up with better ideas than you could alone, or have someone to talk you out of potentially bad ideas. So you get a lot of uplift in just the amount and quality of work you can do with a co-founder.

Content: 
The second reason is moral support. Startups are an incredibly intense and taxing journey. And it's great to have someone you can lean on for support during the tough times. And what I've noticed about the best co-founder relationships is they have this dynamic where both co-founders kind of balance each other out. So if one founder is having a bad day, they're feeling a little down, despondent, and they've become a little pessimistic and feel like the startup is about to die, the other co-founder can just help bring them up a little bit, and keep them going and keep them motivated. And vice versa. Sometimes you get too carried away, you sign a customer and you think you're guaranteed the IPO. And you can use someone to just ground you and bring you back to reality a little bit. And so that's where I kind of find the best co-founding relationships can help kind of even out some of the highs and lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is a startup.

And while you can get sort of productivity increased by hiring people or bringing your own contractors, you don't get that same emotional support that you do from a co-founder. Because ultimately, anyone who's working for you, you're the boss, and they're not as invested in the success of the startup as you are. And you can't really be as open or honest with them about the company as you can be with a peer. And that's what you get from a co-founder.

The final reason I'd say to have a co-founder is pattern matching to success. If you look at a list of the most successful startups in history, think of Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, they all had co-founders when they started. And now I think sometimes people forget this point. Because when you think of these great iconic companies, you associate them with a single person, usually the CEO, who's over time risen to become prominent, famous and a bit of celebrities. You know, when you think of Apple, you think of Steve Jobs, when you think of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and when you think of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, right? I think it's completely true that over time, and we're talking at this point decades, because that's how long successful startups are around for, over that time period, it's pretty common for one person to kind of really drive the company become the figurehead for it and stick out that company for a long period of time. And that's why we remember those people.

Okay, so hopefully, I've convinced you that you really do want a co-founder when you're starting a company. But what if you're really keen to get started in a company right now, and you don't have a co-founder that immediately available, or someone that you can bring on board? Should you wait to get a great co-founder before you start a company? Or should you just go ahead and get started? Well, I think the default answer is that you should wait because of all the reasons I just mentioned, all the benefits that you get from having a co-founder. But Y Combinator has funded single founders, and we have done so successfully. So I've noticed that there are some exceptions to this rule and they tend to follow a particular pattern. And that pattern is that the single founders, those who start company by themselves, has sort of two things that are true.

The second condition is that those single founders, they are able to make progress on that idea without a co-founder, in the short time at least. And that almost always means that they're technical, or at least technical enough to be able to build the first version of the product so they can show it to potential investors, or maybe even to potential co-founders who may want to join the company. And that second point is something I've noticed that the best single founders are also able to do is not only are they tremendously productive in building product and talking to users themselves, they're also able to run a great background search for co-founders and keep their eyes open. And if the opportunity arises, bring on a great co-founder. And I think the best example I can think of here would be Drew Houston of Dropbox.

So Drew applied Y Combinator way, way back now, in 2007. He had a really solid idea for building Dropbox, because he'd already felt the pain of losing his own files. So he knew for sure, there was a better solution to build. But he didn't have a co-founder. And so Paul Graham, the Y Combinator founder, messaged him back saying, "We love your application, you're great, the idea's great, but we really won't fund you without a co-founder. So come back to us when we have one." And Drew kind of went away, continued building the Dropbox prototype, while also looking for co-founders and found Arasha, who would be later the Dropbox CTO and his co-founder. And he applied again, and [inaudible 00:06:34] And now Dropbox is obviously a tremendously successful company.

So that's kind of what I'd ask you to bear in mind is, if you're really keen to get a startup right now, but you don't have a co-founder, ask yourself like, do you have absolute high conviction in this idea, you know sure that this is the idea that we want to work on? There's no other ideas that you'd be open to? And can you really make progress without having a co-founder? And if those things are true, sure. Go ahead and give it a shot. But if not, I'd really suggest you wait until you do have a co-founder to start a company.

Content: 
So when you're thinking about bringing on a co-founder, what should you be looking for in them? Well, I actually think the single most important thing to know about someone before you start a company with them is how do they handle stress. Sort of second most important is how well are they going to help you handle stress. And the reason I say that is startups are very incredibly stressful, intense experience, as I mentioned before. And a great co-founder should be able to support you through those and help you through those. Because if you're determined and motivated, enjoy working together, you'll keep working on this startup for a long period of time. And that's usually what it takes to build a really successful company. So you really don't want to start a company with someone that you don't know particularly well. Because even if you've spent time with them in social events, or you hung out together a little bit, you don't really have insight into how they're going to respond to pressure and stress. And are they someone that's going to stick around when things are tough? And are they someone that's going to help you want to stick around when things are tough?

So the best people to start companies with are always people that you've got some sort of personal experiences, where you kind of know the character and how they're going to respond to those tough situations. And that usually means there's someone, a close friend, or someone that you've worked with, under stressful conditions. So I'd certainly recommend that you be on the lookout and think about that when you're considering co-founders. The second thing I think you really want to look for is understanding the goals and values someone has for starting a company or wanting to do a startup. And honestly, I think when I was younger, I used to think of some goals and values as being sort of fuzzy terms. I didn't need them too much. But over time, I realized, really what they mean is understanding the motivations someone has for doing what they do. And in this context, I think it's really important to talk with someone, even if you know them very well, about why they want to do a startup, what are they hoping for? And the kinds of things that can come out are avoiding conflicting goals, right.

So for example, let's say that you really want to build a high-growth, high-intensity, high-risk startup and you want to push forward, you want to raise venture capital, you want to hire a bunch of people, you want to just really go for it. And your goal is to take the company public and you're okay kind of taking lots of risks along the way to get that. That's a totally fine set of motivations, it's a very common set of motivations for startup founders. But let's say your co-founder prefers to take kind of a slow and steady approach. Maybe they're more motivated by building great software for a small group of people. And they will be totally fine if you just made enough revenue to pay yourselves good salaries and just grew a little bit every year. That's also a completely fine set of motivations for wanting to start a company. But the two motivations there aren't compatible with each other and they'll lead to inevitable conflict.

So what I'd suggest is make sure that you have this conversation. And it's not a perfect predictor, because people's goals and ambitions for a startup change over time. I've seen people start companies because, honestly, they just wanted to get rich. And their hope was that they would be able to sell the company in two to three years for a good amount to a bigger company. But they got two to three years into the company, and they loved it so much, they got so excited by the challenge that they kept working on it, and they're still working on it a decade later. So that's totally fine. I'm not saying that having this conversation means you're gonna know for sure whether your goals and values are aligned over the next decade, which is how long it usually takes if a startup is successful, but at least having the conversation gives you a better chance of finding a co-founder who you're aligned with around a high level important stuff.

Content: 
Now, as you're probably wondering, I'm talking about what you should look for in co-founders, and I haven't mentioned the obvious thing, which is, what skills do they have. So it's obviously really important to have a co-founder who has the right sort of skills to help you grow the company. And usually that means someone who's got complementary set of skills to you, right? So if you're really great at sales, talking to users, getting customers, ideally, you'd have a co-founder who's really great at building product, and writing code, and building software, because the two of you can divide and conquer and get a lot done. Why do you think that's really important? I don't think it's one you should overly fixate it. All right. So more important than anything is just working with someone that you like working with and you trust. And so if sort of the person best fits that description doesn't necessarily have the perfect set of complementary skills, tools, I think that's fine, you should still bring them on as a co-founder. And then you can start hiring people as you need, and make enough progress in the company to get investment, you can hire people to kind of fill in the skills gaps, and that's okay.

Content: 
Another point I'd just make on this is, when you are trying to see if someone's got complementary skills to you, don't go too much into the details of how well do their skills map onto this specific idea you're working on right now. So a common example of this we see sometimes is someone's considering bringing on a technical co-founder. And they want to build an iPhone app. But the co-founder, even though they know them, they trust them, they've worked with him before, that co-founder isn't necessarily an iPhone app developer, they haven't built iPhone apps in the past. That's not a reason to rule someone out as a co-founder, right. What does matter is that they're willing to learn what they need to learn. So if they're not an iPhone developer, they're willing to learn how to do that. And particularly, they're willing to learn things that maybe aren't glamorous, like startups are often just a grind of doing a lot of boring work to get the thing going. And so long as you have a co-founder who's okay with that, it's totally fine if they don't have the perfect set of skillsets. So don't rule someone out who's potentially a great co-founder because they don't have this checklist of specific skills you're looking for. But do make sure you count them in if it's someone that you trust, you like working with, you've got a good sense of how they're going to handle the stress and pressure of the startup journey.

So where should you look for to find co-founders? Well, the answer here is a little obvious. It's to start with the people you already know. So ideally, your friends and colleagues, and kind of ironically, the best time to find a co-founder are when you're not actually necessarily looking for a co-founder to start a company with right now. What I mean by that is, if I were going giving myself advice 10, 15 years ago, what I would say is, rather than sort of trying to pick a startup idea, and go and find co-founders to work on with it, I would suggest that I just look for people to do projects with. So if you're in school, look around, see who's in your class, who's in school, and like, identify people that you think would be cool to work on a project. And this project doesn't have to be a takeover the world idea of a company, just somebody you find interesting. Like maybe you're into games, and you want to build a cool game together. The thing that's awesome about projects is that it's much less scarier and asking for a far lower of commitment if you ask them to work on a project with you than it is to go straight into, "Hey, let's start a company together." Right? So you have sort of a higher chance of people saying yes, if you ask them for this.

And the other thing that's great about projects is you can work on different projects with different people and you can start developing a taste for who do you like? Well, what kinds of personalities? Like what kinds of skills are you actually good at as opposed to what you might think you're good at? And so what kind of complementary skills might you look for in a co-founder. And again, being in school or college is a really ideal time for this because you're surrounded by lots of people who usually have a decent chunk of spare time. And so you can start getting together to work on things that you think are fun. And, again, kind of ironically, although this is I'm suggesting you don't try and start a startup. Projects that you work on in your spare time often tend to be some of the greatest sources for actually finding great startup ideas and building huge companies. Facebook's an obvious example, something that started out as a project while Mark Zuckerberg was an undergrad at Harvard. And now it's turning into one of the biggest companies in the world. But that's not why I'm suggesting you do this. I'm suggesting you can look for people to work on projects with because that's a great way for you to get a sense of what kind of person do you enjoy working with, and what specific type of personality do you work well with.

Title: How to find the right co-founder
Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
And this advice also applies if you're not in college or school, maybe if you're working at a company, like look at your coworkers, like, keep a list of people that you think are particularly smart, particularly capable, who impresses you, and start getting to know them better. And ask them if they're up for working on things in the evenings or weekends. That's the kind of personality...the kind of person who is interested in working on evening and weekend projects is the kind of person that's likely to make a great co-founder. I actually remember years ago at Y Combinator startup school, when it was an in-person physical event, we had Phil Libin, the founder of Evernote, there. And he kind of gave a somewhat extreme version of his advice, which was that he sort of years and years before he started a company knew that he wanted to start a company someday. And so he would only make friends with people that he thought could someday be a co-founder. And now, while I think that advice is maybe a little extreme, if you don't just want to be around people who might be co-founders, there is truth to it. Right? So I think this is kind of the thing where if you make this of a conscious effort well before you start a company, it'll probably the best bet for finding a great co-founder.

Content: 
But let's say you do know for sure that you want to start a company, and you're kind of ready to go, again, right now. How do you start finding co-founders? Well, again, you start in the same place, you start with people that you know. And what I've noticed is an issue people run into here is that they can be really reluctant to just ask people they know to start a company with them. And it's all kind of reasons, like maybe you're worried about how your relationship will change, like maybe you don't value the personal relationship more than the risks of working with someone. And those are fair concerns. But it's not the right optimization for starting a company, you have to make the ask.

Title: How to find the right co-founder
Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
So what I'd suggest, the pretty simple algorithm here for finding co-founders, it's make a list of the people that you know, you're closest to that you think would be great co-founders, and start from top to bottom, and ask every single person there to go grab a coffee and talk to them, and ask them if they'll start a company with you and be your co-founder. If they say no, that's totally fine. Say you understand. But like, who would they start a company with and make it very specific. Ask them, "If you were starting a company, who would be sort of your top three or four co-founders that you want to try and convince to work with you?" And ask them for an introduction to each of those people. So your list keeps growing now. You ask the people you know, if they say no, you at least get some more ideas for names. And then you meet with those people. And you ask them and you simply repeat, repeat the same algorithm, ask them if they'd be interested in being a co-founder with you along. And if they say no, ask them who'd they try to recruit. And so this way, you start growing the tree of potential co-founders beyond those people you immediately know, but at least they're still connected via people that you do know. So they're not just sort of completely random strangers.

Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
The final sort of bit of advice, I'd say, for where to look is go out and try and meet people that just have similar interests to you. Right, it kind of sounds a little bit just like how to have a social life. But this is essentially what finding co-founders reduces to. So if you're an engineer, attend, like developer meetups or work on open source projects, or go to hackathons. Do things where others, engineers and builders are hanging out. And you're likely to find some meets. And if you're not technical, if you're interested in those things, you should totally attend those kinds of events too. But maybe also just attend or find people who are interested in the kinds of things you're interested in. Maybe you're interested in economics and finance, and that's kind of the pool of things, or is a pool of interests where you think you'll find a startup idea. Well, make a real effort to go out and meet people that have similar interests. And in these COVID times, there's lots of online groups and communities that you can join. But even in regular times, there's always ways to find people that have similar interests to you. And because if constantly on the lookout for people who might make co-founders, you have a high chance of finding someone who could be a good fit.

Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
So once you found a potential co-founder, how do you test out and know for sure that you both want to start a company together before making the final commitment? Well, it's not a perfect process. And at some point, you just kind of have to make the leap and hope that it will work out. But one way to de-risk it is to allocate a chunk of time where you agreed to kind of work together. And set yourself a deadline by which time you want to have ideally, like a MVP, or a prototype of something built, or you at least want to have gone out and try it out, pitching some customers and convincing them to pay you if you did build a particular product. These are all things you'd usually do when you're signing up with a new company or testing out new idea anyhow. And do that together, and agree that at the end of the time that you've set aside, that you both have an honest conversation, decide, "Do we both enjoy working together on this? And if so, great, let's go ahead and make the leap." And if not, be honest and say, "Hey, let's go our own separate ways."

Content: 
So making that a little bit more tangible. If you both have the no other commitments, you know, which is pretty uncommon, but sometimes happens if, say, you both graduated college and you didn't go and get a job because you want to start a company, then I'd say treat this like your full time job, right? Say that, "Hey, we're going to set aside a month or three months. And let's just pick idea we're excited about and get as much progress made as we can on building the first version of it, and going out and signing customers." Even if you can't do that full time because you have other commitments, but then do it on evenings and weekends, right. But you'll have to sacrifice some amount of time doing other things in order to actually spend time working together. But the more times, the more hours you can accumulate of working together on the idea, the better sense you'll have for sure if you want to start company or not. Right.

Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
So once you've kind of done that, let's say you've decided that, "Hey, we do want to start the company, and we want to be co-founders," then I think there's two important points you want to make sure that you're in agreement on. First is the equity split, right, like who owns how much of the company. Now, I think the way to think about this is, your sort of default equity allocation should really be 50/50. That's where you want to start from, right, because assuming that nothing's been built yet, you're at the earliest stages of the company, you're both going to make equal contributions, you both want to be equally motivated to work super hard in the company. And all the work is years and years ahead of you. So there is not really too much reason to deviate from a 50/50 equity split early on. However, we have seen different equity arrangements, and they have been successful. And so I kind of think the underlying thing that you're solving for here is making sure that both of you are happy with what the equity arrangement is, and will be motivated to keep working on the company for a long period of time. Right.

Description: YC's Harj Taggar shares advice on how to find the right co-founder for your startup.
Content: 
And so, again, usually that means 50/50, but let's just say that you have been working on the company for a little bit longer, or you de-risked it somehow by yourself, and you're bringing on what is commonly called a later stage co-founder, then sometimes deviate from 50/50 might make sense. But the thing I would really encourage you to do is not optimize for the short term, right. So just because you made a little bit of progress and the idea by yourself, and you have a great co-founder, and you're sort of thinking, "Hey, maybe I should take 70% interest, just leave them 30%," because you've made progress in the last 6 months, I would encourage you not to do that. Startups are a really long-term game and you win by making the best decision long term. Right. So if you have a great potential co-founder, and even though you made a little bit of progress on the company yourself, if you know that they won't be all in and fully committed to the success of the company unless they're a 50/50 partner, you should do that. You should make them 50/50 equity partner so you can keep them as motivated and get as much out of them as possible.

The second thing I think you really want to decide is who's the CEO. Now, this can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation. And to be honest, it's actually, I think, a bit of a red flag if it is uncomfortable conversation. And so as far as the actual title itself goes early on in the startup when it's just two or three co-founders, in terms of how it impacts your day to day and how you divide up responsibilities, the title doesn't actually matter. Like early on, you're all going to be doing a little bit of everything, there's like plenty of like unglamorous grunt work to go around. And just because you have a CEO title doesn't mean you get to sort of abscond from them. Right. So practically, it doesn't matter, like, in terms of who does what.

Content: 
One exception to that might be, if you need to be doing sales, it usually might be good if the CEO is a person, where CEO title is the person talking to customers and users and convincing them because they might feel a little bit more flattered if the CEO is pitching them. And this kind of gets the point of where really the only impact the CEO title has. And that is externally, and I would say specifically for investors. So investors care about seeing that there is sort of a clear leader, and a clear final decision maker or a tiebreaker. And that person should be the CEO. So when you're pitching investors, it's usually better for whoever sort of does most of the talking, whoever is going to be leading those conversations, that that person is the CEO.

Content: 
And now, where you run into problems, and a very, very common source of co-founder friction we see at Y Combinator is where two people really want to be the CEO. Right. And this can sort of...we can see this in Y Combinator interviews, where you end up with two people who kind of talk over each other, they interrupt each other, they can look at each other with a little bit of content when the other person's answering. These are all really, really bad signs, right. So be honest with yourselves, if you think it's really important to you to be the CEO, and you both feel that way, you're not good co-founders for each other. So just avoid all that pain and heartache and don't start a coming together. You ideally want to start a company with someone who doesn't care about that stuff if you do, or you're both indifferent to it and you'll find picking whoever you feel is best suited to the role for now, even if that changes sometime in the future.

So let's kind of wrap up everything we've talked about. Once you're sure you want a co-founder, which I hope I've convinced you to, once you run the process to find some good candidates to be a co-founder, and you've identified someone that you really do want to start a company with, because you spent a little bit of time working on projects together and testing each other out, so to speak, then you have the conversations around what's the equity split and who's going to be the CEO. Now you're ready to formalize things. And formalizing really means the legal act of incorporating a company, setting up a vesting agreement. This is really important. Vesting means that the shares in the company, we don't all get them at once. They vest over a period of time, and there's very standard templates and documents for this that you should really ensure that you have in place. And then you're pretty much good to go.

And you know, the when exactly should you sort of leap from, "Hey, we're hanging out, working together," to, "Hey, okay, let's like do some paperwork." Not a perfect answer to that, but it's just kind of up to you. Like once you've made the commitment to yourself and each other, that we're gonna make a real go of trying to build a company together, that's kind of the trigger for when you start making things real by getting sort of the legal, corporation and paperwork done. So, that's all the advice I have for how to think about finding the right co-founder and how to make it happen. I hope that helps and good luck.
