In the first part, I basically say a startup idea is a hypothesis for why your company is gonna grow really quickly. That hypothesis must compose of three different parts: the problem, the solution, and insight. And the basic parts is your problem should be pretty big, pretty pervasive, have a lot of these characteristics to make it feel like there's a very big market that a lot people have the problem. Don't think you need to know about the solution is that you should not start with a technology, you should start with a problem. And lastly, you're looking to have something that's gonna make your company unique and have some kind of unfair advantage that we call an insight that will show why your company will grow faster than other companies."]

Well, I think there's three main reasons you really want a co-founder when you're starting a company. The first is productivity, you can get a lot more work done if you have someone to divide the work up with. And you can get much better work done if you have a co-founder who maybe has complementary skills, so they can do things that you can't. And there's someone you enjoy discussing ideas with. So you can brainstorm and come up with better ideas than you could alone, or have someone to talk you out of potentially bad ideas. So you get a lot of uplift in just the amount and quality of work you can do with a co-founder."]

From YC\'s Startup School in 2017.\n\nChunk 2/2: \nThat would make a very bad class, Sam,\nif I have.\n[LAUGH]\n[LAUGH] I think Alan is the genuine\nworld expert on this.\nInvented with others, the Xerox Alto,\nwhich we recently restored at\nY Combinator with a group of\nincredible computer scientists.\nAnd I think it\'s the person who has been\nmost thoughtful, probably with anyone I\'ve\never met, about how you build\norganizations to do real innovations.\nSo thank you very much for coming,\nI am super excited to hear this.\nGreat, Sam.\nSo, I\'m thoughtful about it because\nI got to watch masters do it.\nI\'m basically a research scientist, but\nI was interested in the process done\nby far better managers than me,\nwho could deal with larger sets of ideas.\nAnd I\'ll try and give you a gist here.\nBasically, I think,\npeople are here because they\nwant to do startups and make money.\nI just want to point out that\nif you want to make money,\ndon\'t bother with a startup.\nCreate an industry, because then you\nget trillions instead of billions.\nSo it\'s about a factor of a thousand\nbetween doing invention over innovation.\nIn other words, not going\nincrementally from the present but\ncarving out a whole new set of ideas\nthat creates an entirely new context.\nAnd we\'ll see some of\nthe ways to go about it and\nwe\'ll also see some of the barriers.\nAnd see if this, no.\nThis got a bad user interface,\nbecause it has the back button\nnear to the front button.\nSee if that works, so.\nA lot of what these two\ndays are about are talking\nabout the place that most people\nnaturally live, which is the present.\nBut the problem with the present, it is so\nglittery and distracting, there\'s so\nmuch stuff going on.\nThat it\'s hard to think about\nanything except the present.\nAnd if you\'re thinking about the present,\nyour ideas are going to be\nderived from the present.\nAnd therefore,\nthey\'re going to be incremental.\nAnd therefore,\nyou wind up doing innovation,\nnot that you can\'t make money that way,\nbut.\nToday, I\'m going to do\nthe opposite of my usual order,\nI usually like to build\na lot of context first.\nBut I thought in the spirit of the Harvard\nBusiness School and the equivalent at\nStanford, I\'d start off with things like\nresults and process and methods first.\nSo you have a feeling that I\'m actually\n[COUGH] saying something that you might\nquote on quote apply.\nBut the important talk\nis really on Thursday,\nI\'m still struggling with\nmaking it the right size.\nSo today we\'re going to do that, and\nI urge you to copy my email address.\nA lot of you emails,\nwe\'re not going to have time\nto have the discussion\nwe should have here.\nI welcome any questions and\nby the way, while I\'m talking,\nI welcome questions at any time,\ndon\'t be shy.\nOkay and here\'s why school pisses me off.\nA great man in our field, Marvin Minsky\nobserved that this is the best place ever\nto keep you from ever thinking\nabout anything for long enough.\nSo you don\'t want to try and\nlearn in a classroom, it\'s terrible.\nIn fact,\nI don\'t like to do classroom process,\npartly because of the time constraints.\nBut also because it\'s oral,\nwe might as well be sitting around\na campfire, a hundred thousand years ago.\nAnd almost everything that\'s happened\nthat\'s important in the last\nseveral thousand of years,\nhas been basically, literary informed.\nOkay, so\none of my favorite Picasso sayings,\nand he meant a lot of\ndifferent things by this.\nPart of it is the best you can ever do\nwith any kind of representation is make\na kind of a map, even when you\'re\ntrying to make a map of a map.\nYou\'re making a lie compared to\nthe thing you\'re trying to represent.\nBut if you do it right,\npeople can gain some intuition\nabout what the map is about.\nThat\'s what science is all about.\nThis talk in 50 minutes has to be a lie,\nit really is.\nI\'m leaving out a lot of important things.\nBut I think the shadow of the talk or\nwhatever is projected by the talk is\npretty close to the way things actually\nare for doing this very different process.\nAnd I think Picasso didn\'t say,\nbut he knew and\nhe meant, is art is also the lie that\ntells the truth that wakes you up.\nSo if something wakes you up in the next\ntwo days, I will have done my job.\nAnd then, the two days are really\nabout another Picasso quote which is,\nlearn the rules like a pro so\nyou can break them like an artist.\nAnd not doing this is probably\nthe greatest sin of Silicon Valley\nsince the 80s.\nAlmost never, nobody has bothered becoming\na pro particularly in software and\nuser interface design.\nSo when they break the rules,\nthey\'re breaking them like a dumb child\ndoes by throwing rocks through windows.\nAnd it\'s probably the most sickening\nthing to see about the field.\nSo another way of thinking\nabout the mantra is,\nyou have to learn everything and\nthen find a way of forgetting it.\nSo you can have your own ideas, but\nwhat you forget is everything\nexcept the perfume.\nSo when you have an idea then your\nnose will pick up the right scent.\nAnd you\'ll be able to make use of all of\nthe stuff that you\'ve learned after you\'ve\nhad the idea.\nI was specifically asked\nto talk about Xerox PARC\nbecause that was an example of making\ntrillions instead of billions.\nAnd, so\nI thought what I\'ll do here is just show\nyou a couple of results, from Xerox PARC.\nAnd I\'ll then try to give you some of\nwhat it took to get those results.\nSo, Xerox PARC is known for this machine\nthat happened, I gave one to Sam.\nHe got it working with the help\nof some really great people.\nSo this machine happened in 1973\nwhich is 11 years before the Mac, and\nits screen was more than\ntwice the size of the Mac.\nIt was more like a Mac of 1988 or 1989.\nSo it was about maybe 15 or 16 years\nahead of the commercial development.\nAnd the commercial development,\nactually, was based on the stuff\nthat was done on this machine.\nSo this is an example of the best way\nto predict the future is to invent it.\nThere\'s nothing like this before.\nOnce we did it, people could see, yeah,\nthere could be something like\nthis because here it is.\nIn fact, we made 2000 of these,\nso there\'s a lot to look at.\nThey have bit map screens,\nthey had pointing device.\nThe famous GUI,\nwhich you\'re still using today.\nWYSIWYG means what you\nsee is what you get.\nDesktop publishing and\nthe whole media gig.\nWhat does that say?\nThat\'s not helping me, anybody read that?\nSymmetrical reading and writing.\nYeah, symmetrical reading and writing.\nMeaning what you almost never get\non the web, but that you did get in\nmany of the apps of the 1980s,\nwhich is when you get a document,\nthe thing that you read the document with\nalso allows you to edit the document.\nSo if you think about the web,\nit\'s actually much more made for\nconsumption than it is made for\nauthoring, they\'re completely decoupled.\nAnd most of the authoring facilities\nare typing in tiny little windows, and\nthen pushing a button to see what you did.\nSo this is a vast retrogression.\nWhat we call real loop these days,\nwe just called it object\noriented programming back then.\nI made up that term.\nBut what\'s called object\noriented programming today is\nnot what we had back then.\nAnd I don\'t think I\'ll have time to really\ntalk about the profound difference.\nSo if I have to say that what we\ndid at PARC became popular, and\neverybody wanted it even\nif they only got the label.\nComparison is you can go out and buy a set\nof designer jeans with the label Harvard\non them, and for\nall I know with Stanford on them.\nLaser printer,\nmain difference between this and\nwhat you have today is the first\none was a page a second.\nSo most people have never printed\nwith a page a second printer.\nPostscript, outline fonts and so forth.\nEthernet.\nPeer-peer and client server,\nand 50% of the Internet.\nPARC did an Internet before\nthere was the Internet.\nAnd we\'re part of that community, so\nwe participated in the official Internet.\nSo we think of that as eight and\na half inventions.\nHow long did it take?\nWell, 25 researchers for five years.\nThink about that.\nTwo dozen people did all of these\nthings in about five years.\nCost about 10 million to 12 million\nbucks a year in today\'s money.\nReturn is about 35 trillion,\nthis is an old number,\nit\'s probably more like 40 now.\nSo that\'s pretty good return on\ninvestment if you think about it.\nIf you like to do little spreadsheets and\nstuff.\n15% is good, right Sam?\nYeah, so, and it was an industry\nrather than an increment.\nPeople say, well, but\nXerox didn\'t benefit from this.\nThey didn\'t make any money for\nit, that\'s complete *.\nIt\'s made up by companies that\ndon\'t want to invest in research.\nXerox made about a factor\nof 250 over their entire\ninvestment in PARC, so\nthat\'s 25,000% return right there.\nXerox\'s bug was they didn\'t understand\nthe rest of this stuff, but they\ncertainly understood what a laser printer\nwas, and they made billions from it.\nAnd in fact, if you look at it,\nit was better for\nthe world that they stonewalled us,\nbecause no single company can\nhandle an entire industry.\nSo this is made it possible: the Japanese\nhad to do printers slightly,\ndifferently than that.\nAnd this, kind of heaven on Earth,\nlasted for about 12 years,\nXerox finally fired the guy\nwho made it all happen.\nYou\'re thinking,\nhe would have been rewarded,\nright, because he made all this stuff\nhappen, but in fact, they hated him.\nAnd they hated him for\nthe very reason that most companies hate\npeople who are doing something different,\nbecause it makes middle management and\nupper management extremely uncomfortable.\nLast thing they want to\ndo is make trillions.\nWhat they want to do is make a few\nmillions in a comfortable way.\nAnd so this leads to\nan enormous problem that where\nthe real job of upper management in the 20\nand 21st century is to learn things,\nbecause change is the constant\nthing that\'s going on.\nWhat they tried to do is to maximize\nwhatever they had when they got\ninto the job, and\nwhatever the company was successful at.\nIf you think about it,\nif large companies were actually rational,\nthere\'d never be a small company.\nThere\'d be no startups, because large\ncompanies have vastly more resources for\ndoing new things than any\nventure capitalist, right Sam?\nThey\'ve got gazillions of money,\nbut because they refuse to get into\nnew businesses and refuse to change their\nold businesses, you guys have a chance.\nSo, just pray that they\ndon\'t ever wake up.\nNow, the interesting thing is if you\nlook at that collection of inventions,\nyou see every single one of them today.\nAnd what\'s interesting is if I were to\nenlarge this a bit, I would show that\nthere\'s hardly been anything interesting\ninvented since this funding stopped.\nSo it\'s been a nuke,\nbasically a nuclear winter of\npeople cashing in on these inventions,\nand extracting the wealth from them, but\nhardly, any efforts of any\ninteresting kind to go beyond them.\nAnd last point here is\nthe lack of curiosity.\nI met Sam, because he wanted to know\nwhere\'d all this stuff come from?\nI\'ve hardly ever been asked that question.\nIt\'s the most successful generation\nof wealth in computing history,\nand almost nobody wants to know, Sam did.\nAnd the difficult thing about today and\nThursday is the world that you grew up in,\nbecause I don\'t see anybody,\nis anybody here older than 35?\nOkay, yeah, I see a little\nmore reflectivity back there.\n[LAUGH]\nYeah, so\nalmost everybody in the room grew up in\na world that was unlike the world I\'m\ngoing to just tell you about now.\nSo it\'s just many, many things were\nqualitatively different in ways that\nare sometimes difficult to explain.\nSo here\'s the book to read.\nThis is why lectures suck.\nThis is a 500 page book\ndone very carefully\nabout the whole story of ARPA and\nXerox PARC.\nAnybody who\'s really interested,\nread this book.\nAnd this is a tribute I\nwrote to this whole research\ncommunity about I don\'t know 14,\n15 years ago.\nAnd I\'ll hand it out at\nthe end of the class, and\nthe main thing that is interesting\nabout it perhaps is the bibliography,\nwhich has a lot of references on\nmore detailed things you can read\nabout how this particular\ncommunity operated, right?\nAnd the important thing about Xerox PARC,\nwhich is not emphasized enough,\nis that PARC was just another one\nof the ARPA research projects.\nSo there\'s eight years of\nresearch before PARC happened.\nAnd PARC only happened\nbecause of the Vietnam War.\nNobody wanted to try to do this\nstuff inside of a company.\nA company quarterly cycles and\neverything else are really\nantithetical to long range thinking.\nSo this stuff was all funded by\nCold War funds in the public domain.\nSo none of the IP was kept secret,\nbut it was done in a better rhythm.\nSo to get the 35 trillion,\nit actually required not five years,\nbut 12 to 14 years.\nWe were lucky researchers who\ngot our PhDs in this process and\nwe\'re the right age to go to park and\nfinish it off.\nRight and as we\'ll see I\'m not\ngoing to dwell on it much more but\nthe circa of this way of\ndoing things goes back,\nespecially to the radar effort at MIT and\nthe air defense effort and\nthen upper and the park.\nSo there is a long continuity\nhere of kind of how do you,\nwork on things that are,\nThat are doable but where you have to\ninvent several generations of technology\nto get to the thing that\'s doable.\nSo most of these things are not doable\nwith the technology that\'s lying around.\nThat is the problem with\nthese hard problems.\nOkay, so the general world,\nthe normal world.\nThe present, for most of this period,\nwas either punch card accounting machines,\nor their replacement.\nAfter IBM said famously they\'ll no,\nthere\'s no room for more than five or\nsix computers in the entire world,\nthey wound up doing the first\nmass produced computer, the 1401.\nThe first computer I ever programmed.\nTo replace their punch card machines\nbefore other computer companies did.\nSo they did a sort of Trump like reversal,\non their belief and\nthe bound up owning the 60s and\nmuch of the 70s.\nAnd most important thing,\nthis is a dumb sentence because,\nyou don\'t know what these\nmachines were like.\nSo I realized after I put it in there\nthat, why did I even put this in, right?\nBut the way I look at what\'s\ngoing on at any given time,\nwhether it\'s today, 30 or 40 years ago.\nIs whatever\'s going on right now\nis just crap, by definition.\nIf we know about it,\nexcept in the 1/10 of 1% or\n1000 of 1%, it\'s gotten mundane.\nAnd part of it is just because of\nthe bell curve of normality in humans.\nWhatever it is, it gets converted\nto something like normal.\nNo matter how exciting it is.\nAnd so when things are widely successful\nthey tend to bring up the mean\nof the bell curve a little bit,\nfor everybody, raises all boats.\nBut in fact, there\'s also this regression\nto the mean on almost all of these things.\nSo living in the present, man,\nyou\'re just out of it if you\'re trying to\nthink about things from what we have now.\nNow there are two processes.\nThere\'s the bomb project and\nthe radar project at MIT,\nthat had roughly the same process,\nroughly the same difficulty.\nYou have to realize the US was in\nWorld War II for only about two and\na half years.\nPearl Harbour was December of 1941 and\nso we had 42, 43, 44,\nthree and a half years.\nAnd a lot of things got done\nthe Most interesting thing is for\nthe first time in history, really,\na lot of really good scientists and\na lot of really good engineers started\nworking together and cloning each other.\nSo seven Nobel Prizes came\nout of the building 20.\nBecause they were physicists who\nput on their engineering hats.\nTo make 185 different\nkinds of radar systems and\ninstall them in every size of building and\nplane and boat.\nAnd World War II was\nbasically a war of supply.\nAnd it was the ability to a Stave\noff the German submarines that\nhad actually won the war for us.\nMost people don\'t think of it that way.\nBut that\'s what happened.\nSo in the circa I\'m talking about\nI came out of this group and\nthere\'s a couple of good books about how\nthese people went about doing things.\nMaybe the number one thing is what I have\non right hand side is basically he said,\nforget about your ego, I really meant it.\nIt doesn\'t matter who you are,\nhow smart you are,\nhow smart you think you are,\nthere\'s only one thing that counts here,\nis making progress and\nwe make progress through synergy and\nthey learned how to do this and they\npassed it on generation, after generation.\nWell the next round of this,\nafter World War II, was the cold war.\nAnd the air defense system\nthat was done in the 50s.\nAnd again at MIT, the first displays\nthat you could interact with.\nThat is essentially a stylus in the guy\'s\nhand, it was called a light gun.\nSo he\'s pointing at something on\nthe screen and squeezing the trigger.\nLike you would put a Silas down and\npush it down and\nthe light gun can tell, computer can\ntell what the light gun is working at.\nSo you can do all of the stuff,\nthat you\'re used to today.\nTo give you an idea of\nwhat these guys did,\nI can\'t really see what this is right?\nIt\'s just like it\'s obviously\nfour floors of a building.\nNow, this is a football field.\nAnd if you notice the second floor,\nit says computer A and computer B.\nEach one of those computers\nhad 50,000 vacuum tubes.\nBoth running the same programs\nat the same time and many\nother interesting things I don\'t have time\nto talk about but, I\'ll just say that when\none of these computers started crashing\nit took it three or four days to crash.\nAnd the reason is,\nit was running diagnostics on itself.\nAnd every time an instruction failed,\nit would patch\nin a simulated instruction based on\nwhat instructions were still working.\nSo what would happen is the machine\nwould just get slower and\nslower and more software-like.\nMore like a Turing machine and\nusually they could fix it before\nit came all the way down,\nmeanwhile the other one was still working.\nBut, even though I\nshouldn\'t be digressing,\nthere\'s a fun thing here, there were\n32 of these concrete bunkers made.\nSo the two interesting things,\nwhat happened to this stuff, anybody know?\nDoes this look like anything\nyou\'ve ever seen before?\nSpace program stuff?\nNo, that\'s, but-\nAirline meter, sorry.\nYeah, yeah,\nthis actually was the invention of our,\nair traffic control system.\nThat\'s what it was designed to do,\nexcept that it was designed to control\ntraffic of both American and\nRussian bombers and\nin fact, if many of the displays before\nthey replace them with flat screen.\nDisplays is basically the same big round.\nSo this whole system last until 1982.\nWhen the last one was finally\ndecommissioned and 50,000 vacuum tubes.\nThey\'re like incandescent light bulbs.\nThey blow out, so\nthey\'re always blowing out.\nSo, of course,\nthere are redundant ones there.\nWhere did we get the vacuum tubes from?\nThink about it,\nall the way through the 70s.\n[INAUDIBLE]\n[INAUDIBLE]\nNo, this is back,\nno transistors in these machines.\nNo transistors, these are-\nRussia.\nAbsolutely.\nHow did you know that?\nI heard it before.\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\nThat\'s good, and you remember it.\nThat\'s good, yeah?\nFor the last 12 or\n18 years of this defense system,\nwhich was never used against the Russians\never, because they never tried to bomb us.\nAnd was actually obsolete very soon\nbecause of ICBMs, it couldn\'t track them.\nThere\'s a whole other system for\ndoing that, yeah.\nBut we kept it going and\nthere are reasons why it was kept going.\nWe bought while we\'re still\ncontending in the Russia for\nthe cold war,\nwe buying vacuum tubes from them too.\nBy the way, people still keep buying\nvacuum tubes from the Russians for\nGetting old 50s guitar amp sounds.\nThose overdriven sounds.\nAnd this guy, who was one of the inventors\nof artificial intelligence, and\nthe inventor of the programming language\nLISP, John McCarthy, looked at one\nof these in the 50s and said, Everybody is\ngoing to have one in their home someday.\nBecause he didn\'t give a  about\nthe concrete bunkers or\nanything else like that.\nBecause what he thought was, yeah, this is\nlike a electric power generating station.\nNobody ever sees them but\nthey\'re out there.\nWe have wires going to the home for,\nit\'s like where we get our water from,\nit\'s where we get our gas from.\nThe utilities, so he thought there\nwould be an information utility, and\nit will actually be a human right,\nlike the telephone, to have\none of these things In your home that is\nconnected to all the worlds information.\nSo that was one of the earliest and\nmost influential ideas.\n1962, I\'m going to show you a system\ndone on one of these super computers.\nThis is done on the test computer at\nLincoln Labs for this whole SAGE system so\nthis computer was close to\nthe size of this entire building.\nWith one guy on it,\nyeah at 3 o\'clock in the morning.\nSo, take a look at this.\nThis is Ivan Sutherland.\nSo, it doesn\'t really even have a display.\nIt\'s actually simulating\na computer display here.\nThis is just an oscilloscope.\nSo, what Ivan wants to do,\nis to draw a flange and so he says,\nit\'s kind of like this.\nNow take these guys and\nmake them all mutually perpendicular and\nwow, sketch pad just solved that problem.\nSo it\'s a dynamic problem solver in there.\nFirst window then clipped.\nNow it wants to put a hole in the flange.\nSo these are guidelines.\nand the first thing he does is said,\nokay, I want to make this parallel.\nAnd you see, sketch pad keeps them\non the line there and lines them up.\nAnd now, he\'s using them as\nguidelines to draw a dash lines.\nYou see here, he misses Whoop, okay.\nOkay, and\nnow he makes the guidelines invisible.\nThey\'re still there.\nThe constraint was co-linearity there.\nAnd he has a knob to continuously zoom.\nSo this is the first\ncomputer graphics ever.\nAnd he wants some rivets to go along\nwith that flange, and so again he,\nthis is why this system is called a sketch\npad because you just casually draw.\nJust going to use that as the center for\nthe ark here.\nAnd again he\'s going to say,\ntake these guys and\nmake them mutually perpendicular and\nhere sketch pad solves that problem.\nSo you wind up with a symmetric object.\nAnd he can change things and\nhe\'ll get another solution.\nHe could have constrained the side\nlinks to be ratios of each other.\nAnd the kind of problem\nsolving this system could do,\nwell included non linear problems.\nSo there, he\'s got a rivet.\nAnd what\'s cool about this,\nthat is a master rivet,\nwhat we\'d call a class in\nobject oriented programming.\nSo this is not that rivet, but\nan instance of that master rivet.\nMight wonder, why is that display\nbouncing around like that.\nWell it\'s putting up\nevery dot individually,\nat about half the power of this super\ncomputer is being used to just do that.\nSo here another instance, another rivet.\nHere is another one, here\'s another one.\nAnd he says whoops I didn\'t want\nto have those crossbars there, so\nI\'ll go back to the master rivet and\nmake the crossbars invisible.\nThey\'re still there but invisible,\nand we see the instances.\nSo this is object oriented programming.\nMaybe nicer than you\'ve seen it.\nGet rid of those guys and now,\nthat construction that he made,\nhe\'s made it into a master.\nSo he can make instances of it.\nOkay, get the idea?\nI had a question.\nYes.\n[INAUDIBLE] Sort of regressed\nfrom here\nWell anybody in this class ever seen\nSketchPad before?\nOkay, so that\'s part of the answer.\nYeah we\'ll go along, it\'s sort of\nthe larger question that we have.\nIt\'s worthwhile bringing up the question\nHe\'s rotating three of them.\nSo, this is the most shocking thing\nI;d ever seen when I went to graduate\nschool in 66.\nThis was, the system was only\nthree years old at that time.\nAnd I\'ve been programming for\nfive years and just for\nconventional programming and\nseeing this, it blew my mind.\nBecause it was exactly different than\neverything I thought about computing.\nAs soon as I saw I, I realized yeah,\nof course you can do that.\nBut I didn\'t think about that.\nIvan did.\nOkay so Sketchpad, interactive computer\ngraphics in a way we recognize today.\nFor the first time, objects,\nmasters and instances.\nThe programming was not done by\nthe kind of programming today, but\nby problem solving, which I think\nyou can imagine is much nicer.\nLike it will find the solution.\nAnd it creates automatic\ndynamics simulations,\nso it\'s not just for drawing bridges.\nWhen you draw the bridge in,\nit knows how to simulate the bridge and\ntell you what the stresses\nin this trains are.\nSo I said to Ivan, Ivan you did all\nof this and what is this PhD thesis?\nSaid, you did all this in one year by\nyourself, how could you possibly do it?\nAnd he said, well,\nI didn\'t know it was hard.\n[LAUGH]\nHe just went after what the problem is.\nAnd if you read his thesis,\nand you should,\nbecause you can see there are things that\nare of absolute goodness still today.\nIt\'s not just relatively good for\nbeing done more than 50 years,\nit\'s absolutely good.\nAnd his thesis is, every other page is\nan apology because it doesn\'t do more.\nbecause Ivan was working on the problem.\nHe wasn\'t working out what you could do,\nhe was working on the problem.\nYeah, so sketch pad was a bombshell in\nthis research community\nthat was about to happen.\nbecause right away,\nyou were looking at the future.\nYou just had to believe that\na building sized computer was going to\nwind up on a laptop, or\neven something in a desk.\nSo the main player here back then\nwas a guy by the name of Lick.\nLicklider, he got given some money\nin 1962 by ARPA before the day,\nand when anybody asked him what are you\ngoing to do, this is what he would say.\nComputers are destined to become\ninteractive intellectual amplifiers for\neveryone in the world,\nuniversally networked worldwide.\nHe would not say anything more.\nSimply gave out money.\nNow here\'s some bullet points.\nI hate bullet points,\nbut this is a perfect class I\nthink to put bullet points in.\nAnd I found 16, that will tell\nyou just what you have to do.\nAnd I\'ve thought of a few since,\nbut 16 is more than enough.\nSo the first thing, was just picking\nan idea that\'s worth dedicating your life,\nif necessary to.\nSo, this stuff was human destiny,\nfixing big human problems,\nlike we can\'t think very well.\nWe need to make things\nto help us to think,\nwe need to make things\nto help us cooperate.\nSo these were save the world kind of ideas\nand they were done when the Russians where\nstarting to test hydrogen bombs and\nthings did not look so good.\nForget about goals,\nthe problem is that goals tend to be much\nmore idiosyncratic to individual humans.\nSo research wants to be a vision.\nSo notice there aren\'t any\ngoals in the ARPA dream.\nAnd that allowed Licklider to fund 15 or\n20 super\nsmart people who thought they had\nways of approaching the dream.\nAnd some of these people didn\'t\n[BLANK AUDIO] agree, and\nsome of them hated each other.\nAnd Lick didn\'t give a , he just\nwanted smart people working on this dream.\nSo fund people, not projects.\nARPA never decided.\nAnd we\'ll see a slight\nmodification of this.\nBut basically, fund people, not projects.\nIf you\'re going to do that,\nyou better have the very best people.\nSo, if you know,\nMacArthur grants are for individuals.\nBut this funding was funding groups.\nLike you fund in MacArthur,\njust five years, forget it.\nNobody at MacArthur asks,\nyou don\'t get a second MacArthur grant.\nHere, they would get another grant if\nthey\'d done something good in five years,\nbut basically the idea of\nMacArthur is throw away.\nWe\'ve identified this person of extreme\npotential, let\'s just give him five years\nof funding and\nwe won\'t cry if they don\'t do anything.\nIt turns out most MacArthur people\ndo something because the people that\nattract attention are people\nwho are not working for money.\nThey\'re doing it because they must,\nthey are people like artists are people\nwho do their art because they must.\nCommunity not a project,\nhave to fund problem finding,\nthis really drives funders crazy today.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nMost of the time,\nwhen you are working on hard problems,\nyou don\'t know what the right problem is.\nThis is why visions are really good.\nVisions are detached.\nIf you pick a problem too early you might\nbe picking it out of the current context.\nAnd therefore, you\'re going to be\nhampered unless you are incredibly lucky.\nSo ARPA put a lot of money into just\npeople thinking around with stuff.\nMilestones not deadlines.\nBaseball not golf.\nMeaning, when you lose a stroke in golf,\nyou cry.\nWhen, you strike out in baseball, you\nbetter not cry, because you\'re going to do\nit a lot, and\nthis is what Licklider said to them.\nHe said look, if you\'re batting 3.50\nin baseball, you\'re really doing well.\nAnd if you look at what we\'re\nfunding if we bat 3.50,\nwe\'re going to change the world.\nThat\'s what happened.\nNobody cares about all\nthe stuff that didn\'t work.\nAnd people said,\nwell what about the 65% failure?\nAnd they said, well it\'s not\nfailure in baseball, it\'s overhead.\nHitting a ball is hard, when you\'re doing\nsomething really, really hard, the times\nyou don\'t do it well is just overhead for\ndoing it the times you do well.\nAnd this is probably the biggest\ndistinction that business people do\nnot understand.\nbecause what they want is actually teeny,\nlittle uninteresting projects that\nare guaranteed for your success.\nBut sports is right in front of it.\nSports is really hard, and most sports\npeople are not succeeding all the time.\nAnybody know baseball here?\nWhat\'s the thing in baseball,\nit\'s called an error?\nLike what?\n[INAUDIBLE]\nNo, just fielding.\nError.\nYeah, what\'s an error in baseball?\nNot catching a fly ball.\nHow good are the average fielders?\nThey\'re 98.5% effective.\nSo, really good ones are like one\npercent error and so an error and\ntechnical stuff is designed to build\na computer system and failing to build it.\nLike anybody should be, decide to build\na software and failing to build it.\nYou just should be able to knock that off.\nBut you\'re in this other range\nwhen you\'re trying to do design.\nAnd it\'s really two different things.\nSo, here\'s a memo Lick wrote in 63,\nshortly after he got this initial\nmoney from ARPA to members and\naffiliates of\nthe Intergalactic Computing Network.\nAnd they asked him,\nwhy did you call it that?\nHe said, well engineers always give you\nthe minimum, and I want a network that\nspans the entire planet, so\nI\'m asking for an intergalactic one.\nAnd when they scale it down,\nwe\'ll still get, so\nthat\'s where the internet came from,\nliterally.\nThe original name of the Internet\nwas the intergalactic computing,\nnobody knew how to do it back then.\nFor instance, packet switching\nhad not been invented in 63.\nAnd here\'s a nice line in that memo,\nif we succeed in making an intergalactic\nnetwork, then our our main problem will\nbe learning to communicate with aliens.\nAnd he meant this in\nthe biggest possible way, and\nI don\'t have time to really explain it,\nit\'s really interesting.\nPeople who are interested in\nthis should write me an email.\nHe didn\'t mean just other people.\nHe meant other software, other computers.\nHe meant what does it mean to\ncommunicate when you scale things up?\nSo this guy was a big thinker.\nNumber nine,\nyou can\'t think inside the Beltway.\nThat\'s of course referring to Washington,\nDC.\nBut this is a general principle.\nThey asked him why, and he said,\nwell, because there\'s too much noise.\nThere\'s just too much politics.\nThere\'s too much .\nAnd nobody does research in Washington,\nDC.\nSo the last thing we want to do,\nas our profounders, is to try and\nthink while we\'re there.\nOur job is to get money out of\nthe government and pass it along.\nAnd so a solution to that would say,\nhey let\'s not be here for\nlonger than two years.\nAnd so every two years, so Lick set\nup the process to get his successor,\nhappened that Ivan Sutherland got drafted\ninto the army at just the right time.\nAnd so they grabbed him and so\nat age 26 Ivan ran this whole show and\nman was he good.\nHe was a second lieutenant sharing\nmeetings with generals and\none of the most famous\nthings recalled of that.\nSome general was going on and\non at some point Ivan said,\ngeneral you have just two minutes\nto make your point if you have one.\nThat\'s about the simplest\nway of describing Ivan.\nBob Taylor and Larry Roberts.\nThose are the four that made this happen.\nTaylor is special because he is\nalso the guy who set up park.\nAnd he was a student of Licklider.\nLicklider was intuitively wonderful,\nTaylor was a student of what\nwas wonderful about Licklider.\nAnd he could explain everything that\nLicklider could do and why it worked.\nSo here\'s a couple things,\nI\'m not going to go about, but\nbasically the idea here is it\nisn\'t like lets look around and\nsee what is available and\nwhat we can do with it.\nThe idea was stick with the vision and\njust make every frigging\nthing that\'s necessary.\nIt doesn\'t matter what it is.\nIf we have to make a new kind of\nintegrated circuit, we\'ll do it.\nAll of these things were done.\nSo it\'s very much like these other\ncultures where nobody worried about\nwhether you had half centimeter radar in\nbuilding 20 at MIT, they just did it.\nAnd here\'s one that is really a bug today.\nAnd if you don\'t have the chops,\nyeah you shouldn\'t make your tools,\nyou shouldn\'t make your\nown operating system.\nYou shouldn\'t make your own programming\nlanguage because that\'s not what you\'re\ntrying to do.\nIf you do have the chops, and you better\nnot do his unless you have the chops,\nthen you have to make your\nown hardware and software and\noperating system in\nthe programming languages.\nOtherwise you\'re working in the past\non some vendor\'s bad idea of what\ncomputing is about.\nSo part of this deal,\nremember what Picasso said.\nYou have to get really much,\nmuch better than\nwhat most people want to today,\nand here\'s another reversal.\nToday people buy hardware and\nput software on it basically to\nmake the hardware look good.\nThe ARPA community in part\ndid exactly the opposite.\nIt started off with the software.\nUsing super computers\nto simulate the thing.\nAnd when you got the software\nthe way you wanted it,\nthen you\'d design the computer\nthat would optimize and\nmake more efficient what you\nwere doing on a super computer.\nThat is what Sketchpad was.\nNobody thought that the next graphic\nsystems were going to be done on\na computer the size of this building.\nOkay, and then make a bunch of them.\nSo almost every project\nin the ARPA project,\nthey actually made enough of them so\nthey could be used as tools.\nThey weren\'t just demos.\nAnd so part of this invention process had\nto require a kind of limited engineering.\nPark, for\ninstance, had a thing where whatever\nyou did you had to make 100 of them.\nMade an Ethernet,\nit had to run 100 machines.\nIf you made a time sharing system,\nit had run 100 users.\nIf you made a personal computer,\nyou had to be able to build 100 of them.\nLearn how to argue.\nThis is what you learned as\na graduate student there.\nArgue for clarity, not to win.\nIt\'s the biggest bug today.\nPeople are always contending with each\nother, trying to be winners and losers,\nand that\'s one of\nthe problems with Washington,\nthey\'ve forgotten what their job is.\nNow what you have to do is\nunderstand these complicated things.\nHere\'s a biggie,\nevery researcher at Park was a second or\nthird generation PhD\nthat ARPA had created.\nRight, eight years.\nIt wasn\'t just the stuff in the past.\nI\'ll show you a couple more of those,\nwow we\'re getting closed to, but\nit was creating the next generation.\nAgain, this is baseball.\nBaseball you have to develop talent going\nall the way the down to little league.\nAnd they did and\nthe other thing is a little difficult to,\nsome of you will understand this readily.\nThat the reward of doing this stuff\nwasn\'t the reward of making it happen\nbecause a lot of times it didn\'t happen.\nIt was a reward of actually being funded\nto work on what the actual problems were.\nI can\'t emphasize this too much.\nWorking on what the problems actually are\nrather than something that\'s going to get\na paper, something that\'s going to make\nyou money, but taking big human problems.\nCould be something like drinkable water.\nFor the 70% of the planet\nthat doesn\'t have it.\nDoesn\'t matter, there\'s no other goal.\nIf you pick one of those things that\'s\na great one, worth putting your life into.\nOkay, so background was partly tinkering.\nA lot of people came from New York,\ndown where the world trade center was.\nBefore the world trade center, there was\nabout a mile across Manhattan Island that\nwas nothing but electronic surplus stores.\nMow a few lawns,\nput a dime into the subway and\nyou could go down there and\nbuy almost anything to mess around with.\nAnd that group got used to,\neverybody was broke.\nThere was a kit to build\nyour own oscilloscope.\nAnd if you wanted an oscilloscope and\nyou were broke,\nyou could get one of these on time for\n$30 or $40 bucks and build it.\nAnd I\'m going to just\nput, these are just washed out anyway so\nI\'m just going to go past.\nOkay, so Moore\'s Law, this was\nthe original thing in Moore\'s paper.\nDoubling every year.\nHe picked MOS silicon which is too\nslow to make things out of, but\nwould get faster if you made it smaller.\nHere\'s doubling every two years,\nand what happened.\nThe prediction was 30 years and so\nwhat happened was, very in line\nwith doubling every two years to every 18\nmonths, and there is physics behind this.\nThis wasn\'t just an engineering\naspiration, and so\nif you believe this you had\nsomething really worthwhile.\nAnd I\'m going to skip past Engelbart here.\nSet it up so I see it like that,\nthat leaves a corner.\nI think you should see\na little of this though,\nbecause the same time the mouse was\ninvented this was done at Rand.\nAnd how did the Rand people go about it,\nwell at midnight they will go through\npeople\'s waste paper baskets.\nTo see how they worked,\nwhat were they throwing away?\nAnd what people were doing when\nthey were working was making all\nkinds of diagrams and\nlittle flowcharts and all this stuff.\nSo they said, okay,\nwell let\'s invent the first tablet,\nAs good as most of the tablets\nyou\'ve ever used today.\nIt\'s the hallmark of these people is they\ngenerally did it good enough and here\'s-\nYou may start to edit the flow diagram.\nFirst we erase the flow arrow,\nthen move the connector out of the way, so\nthat we may draw a box in it\'s place.\nThe printing in the box is being used\nas commentary only in this case.\nThe box is slightly too large,\nso we may change its size.\nThen, draw a flow from\nthe connector to the box.\nAttach a decision element to the box,\nand draw a flow from it to scan.\nWe then erase the flow-\nOkay so this is about 1968 or so.\nAgain on a big room sized mainframe,\nwith one guy.\nBut, this system really, you could ask\nyour question even more about this.\nThis system was [LAUGH] one of the best\nsystems I\'ve ever used in every.\nIt felt so intimate, it was so\ndifferent from the mouse.\nIt was one of the things\nthat we actually looked at.\nI guess I do have to\nshow the next thing here.\nJust so you think that VR\nwasn\'t something done recently.\nBut the second thing Ivan\ndid after he came back,\nthe thing that when it came\nback from Arpo was to do these.\nI worked on this one when\nI was a graduate student.\nYou could grab things and have\nthe thing in your hand, grab things and\nmove them around it.\nIt\'s a little exciting because instead\nof the thing that you used to today.\nIn the art had two CRTs with 15,000 volts\nright above your ears crackling away.\nSo it was a very exciting thing to do and,\nof course,\none of the hardest things was to do\ngood head positioning back then.\nThere are many ways of doing it.\nOne of the things they did here,\nI won\'t explain what it is, but\nit was hooked to a crane.\nSo as you walked around\nthis big room at MIT,\na crane would automatically follow you\nwith the positioning thing over your head.\nTo find out what this was about.\nAnd, man, I\'m getting killed\nbecause I should stop right now.\nBut I really have two more things to do,\nif you could give me two more minutes,\nI will do them.\nFirst one here is,\nthis is something you have to think about.\nLet time go one way, and\nprogress go the other way.\nYay boo, yay boo, it goes up it goes down.\nThis is the way people\ntend to measure things.\nThe problem is they never\nput in a threshold.\nIf you put in a threshold, then the only\nthings above the threshold count.\nLike if these are reading scores,\nNothing counts.\nWe, of course,\nnever get above the threshold.\nSo it doesn\'t matter whether they go up or\ndown.\nAnd, what is actually needed\nchanges over in time.\nYou need more, and if you\'re measuring\nto a baseline, which people usually do.\nOne of the ways of improving things, or\nmaking it look like you\'re not doing such\na bad job is to lower the base line.\nFor example, Apple completely\nlowered the base line on what\nconstitutes reasonable user interface for\niPhones and iPads.\nInterfaces on the system beforehand\nhad an undo, and these don\'t.\nAnd I can name 15 more things.\nThink about it.\nSo what they did is they decided,\nwell we\'re just not going to work\non all of those problems anymore.\nWe\'re going to condition\nthe unsophisticated public\nto do work at the level of a two year old,\nor a 92 year old.\nAnd we\'re just going to\neliminate everything in between.\nAnd the public has bought it,\nbecause you don\'t want to count noses\nwhen you\'re looking for quality.\nPeople can be talked into anything.\nSo what you have to do on this\nstuff is you have to pick\nsomething that is\nabsolutely above that line.\nWe call that MacCready "Sweet Spot",\nhe\'s the guy who did manpowered flight.\nAnd once you have achieved that,\nit opens up a whole region\nthat you can explore, and\nthat\'s what we did at park.\nAt Moon Shot,\nwas set space travel back 50 years.\nEverybody uses a metaphor\nwe need a moon shot.\nNo we don\'t need a moon shot.\nYou just don\'t do space travel\nwith chemical rocketry.\nAnd whats interesting about\nthe people who like Jeff Besolson.\nYeah, Elan, [LAUGH] they don\'t get it.\nMv = mv.\nEvery child who read science\nfiction in the 50s knew this.\nWhat that means is, you either have to\ncarry a shitload of reaction mass with\nyou, if you\'re doing chemicals, because\nyou can\'t get the velocity high enough.\nSo you have to put out a lot of mass, and\nif you do that you have to lift that mass.\nSo you wind up with 45 story building\nrockets just to get into orbit.\nThat is nuts.\nAnyway, I will not go on that.\nSo, but the thing that was a tragedy was\nthat they were very good proposals for\nhow to get that high exhaust velocity\nUsing various forms of atomic power.\nAnd it was something that\nthe public was not interested in,\nthe moon shot was not about space travel.\nOkay, so, I\'ll skip past this.\nBecause I want to end with,\nyeah, here\'s, so\nthis tablet computer I thought up in 1968.\nIt had two initial forms.\nOne was the familiar tablet, and\nthe other one was what Ivan\'s had mount of\ndisplay was inevitable with Moore\'s Law.\nAnd then, Nicholas Negroponte had\nthis idea of wearing a watch and\ncommunicating with the rest of the world.\nOkay, so here\'s the last little segment,\nand then I\'ll let you go.\nWayne Gretzky,\nyou know who Wayne Gretzky, is I\'ll bet.\nGreatest hockey player who ever lived.\nAnd he was just a little guy,\nhe tried to avoid fights.\nThey asked him why he took so\nmany shots on goal.\nAnd he says, well you miss 100%\nof the shots you don\'t take.\nSo he wasn\'t trying to be careful.\nHe scored more goals than anybody\nin history by a thousand.\nSo, the fact that his percentage of\nmisses was also high was irrelevant.\nAnd they asked him,\nwhy he was better than anybody else?\nAnd he said, well, a good hockey\nplayer goes to where the puck is,\na great one goes to where\nthe puck is going to be.\nAnd he didn\'t mean tracking the puck.\nHe meant getting into a place where\nsomebody could pass him the puck where\nhe could make a goal.\nSo what he did is he looked\nat the entire configuration,\nsaw where the future was going to be,\nand went to that place in the.\nSo you can make a game to\ninvent the future out of this.\nAnd so you start off with\na cosmic goodness intuition.\nLike for me that tablet one was good.\nYou identify a favorable exponential,\nlike Moore\'s Law.\nYou take the cosmic\nintuition out 30 years,\nand you ask, can we say, wouldn\'t it\nbe ridiculous if we didn\'t have this.\nAnd say 30 year out, or 30 years away,\nwell of course, we\'ll have one.\nThat\'s what that exponential means.\nAnd bring it back to the 10,\n15 year point.\nAnd that point, you can just pay money\nbecause that\'s also what Moore\'s law and\nwhat Turing means.\nIs, if you pay a lot of money now,\nyou can make the commodity computer of 10,\n15 years in the future.\nThat\'s what the Alta was.\nIt was about 50 times faster than what\nyou got out of the time sharing terminal.\nAnd make a bunch of them, And\nyou intertwine it, so, run the software.\nAnd then you can do two kinds\nof computing in the future.\nOne kind of computing is zillions of\nexperiments to get a user interface\nthat would be universal for.\nRight now, 5 billion people, and deal with\nmillions of people who were doing\napplications you\'ve never seen before.\nAnd the other thing you can do,\nthe thing on the right there is Microsoft\nWord as it was at Xerox Park in 1974.\nIf you optimize the code,\nyou can get what the applications\nare going to be ten years out.\nSo those are the two things you can do\nby doing this super computer thing.\nAnd it cost money.\nIn today\'s dollars those altas\ncost about 125K a piece,\nand we made two thousand of them.\nThink about that.\nGot to be a funder who\'s serious.\nXerox went bat  when we did it.\nThey really went bat * when\nwe wanted to cash them in.\nBut I\'ll just leave you this\nsince I\'m over time now.\nI\'ll leave you this as one of\nthe ways of escaping the present.\nHave a glimmer of an idea, take it so far\nout that you don\'t have to worry about how\nyou\'re going to get there, and\nthen you just bring it back.\nSo instead of innovating\nout from the present,\nwhat you want to do is to invent\nthe future from the future.\nYou are living the future,\nand bring the future back.\nThank you.\n[APPLAUSE]']
