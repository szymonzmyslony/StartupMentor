commercialize it.

At YC, we've funded more than 75 companies in this situation. We also recently went on a [Bio
Tour](https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-bio-tour-2020/) where we went around to research universities and talked with
hundreds of students and professors in the life sciences about commercializing their research. These are the most common
topics founders have asked us about.

## Deciding who should spin out

In a typical spin-out situation, there are several people who worked on the research, including a mix of students, post
docs and faculty. The first thing you need to decide is who is going to work on the company and who is going to stay at
the university.

A lot of scientific founders have misconceptions about how to structure their founding team. Here are the most common
ones.

*Misconception 1. You can start a company while continuing your academic career*

Here is a blunt fact that often makes founders uncomfortable: your company has little chance of success unless someone
who worked on the original research is willing to leave their university role to start this company.

If you are a student graduating soon, you can just wait until you graduate; that‚Äôs a perfect time to start a company.
But otherwise, at some point you will have to make an intentional decision to leave so you can run the company.

*Misconception 2. You should find a CEO to run the company*

Too many scientists believe that they should remain in academia and find a CEO to start a company around their
invention. This is almost always a bad idea. For one, it‚Äôs hard to find a great CEO to run a company at this early
stage. Truly great CEOs are scarce, and they usually have much better opportunities available to them than running an
idea-stage startup with no funding. As a result, most scientists that try this approach either never find a CEO or end
up settling for a mediocre one. It‚Äôs even worse if your university tries to find a CEO for you.

But even if you could draft any person in the world to run your company, it still probably wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea. The
best CEO for this stage is one of the people who did the original research. The people who did the original research
will be far more invested in the success of the venture than any outsider. They are also far more qualified to build a
company around it because their domain knowledge of the field is much more valuable than whatever general business
skills an outside CEO would bring.

A related misconception is believing that the research is done and that all that‚Äôs left is to commercialize it. If this
were true, perhaps an outside CEO would make sense. However, it rarely works out that way. Usually you find that the
thing the market wants is not quite the thing that you‚Äôve invented, and that more research needs to be done. The
original inventors can take this feedback and make adjustments; an outside CEO will just be stuck.

*Misconception 3. You need someone with business experience on the founding team*

Many scientists think that to start a company you need someone with prior business and financial experience. This is
just not the case. In the first couple of years, there is typically very little "business" to be done, and whatever
business skills you need you will pick up along the way. Most of the scientists we fund at Y Combinator have no prior
experience in business.

People who work in business like to make it sound hard, as if business were like quantum physics, a field that needed to
be studied for years to master. The fact is, it's not even close.

*Misconception 4: You should raise money first, then leave the university*

Often, people are unsure of whether they want to risk leaving a stable academic role to pursue a startup. So they take
their idea and pitch it to some local VC firms. They figure if it's a good idea, the VC firms will fund them, validating
the idea and giving them a smooth transition out of their university job and into a well-funded company.

While VC firms will occasionally fund spin-outs this way, usually they don't. Unfortunately, too many founders get
turned down by VCs and conclude that their idea must be bad and give up. Actually, the issue is that it's just too early
at this point to raise money from VCs.

Typically, founders will need to work full-time on their company for 1+ years before it is ready to raise a
multi-million dollar round from VCs. In the meantime, they sustain themselves by self-funding from their savings,
getting government research grants, raising a small amount from friends and family, or raising a small "pre-seed" round
from angel investors, accelerators, or seed funds.

Founders who won't quit their job before they raise money often get stuck in a catch-22. They are waiting for an
investor to take a bet on them before they quit their job. But the investors are waiting for the founders to believe
enough in their own company to quit their job\!

*What I recommend*

The ideal situation is that two or more people from the lab who did the work leave together to start the company as
cofounders. One full-time founder is also ok. One of the people who leave to start the company should be the CEO.

In many cases, other people who were involved in the research want to remain behind at the university but still
contribute in some way. That‚Äôs fine. Those are often called ‚Äúacademic cofounders‚Äù or ‚Äúscientific cofounders‚Äù and they
can still be very helpful. But the founders who are going to be full-time are the most important.

## Deciding when to spin out

In the early stages of developing a new technology, you‚Äôll make faster progress still at the university, taking
advantage of university resources. It‚Äôs the ideal place to do the initial experiments to prove that your idea could
work. You can even do some testing of market demand for a new product, through programs like NSF I-Corps or just by
calling up potential customers/stakeholders. At some point, though, that will flip, and being at a university will start
to slow you down, because universities are not set up to commercialize technologies.

It‚Äôs possible to leave too early and possible to wait too long before leaving. Unquestionably, though, the far more
common mistake is to wait too long.

Most founders wait too long because leaving is scary. Academia is a comforting environment. No one is pressuring you to
leave and leaving seems risky so the natural thing to do is to keep delaying it. There's a temptation to make the
technology perfect before spinning out, and there's always "one more experiment" you could do. If you don't stop this
cycle, you'll never leave.

Often after people do leave, they realize that a lot of the work they did in the last year was wasted, because some of
their assumptions about what the market wanted were wrong. They also realize that they are now moving so much faster as
a company that they could have saved months of time by spinning out a year earlier.

## Splitting up Equity

After you've decided who is going to be full-time on the startup and what everyone's role will be, you'll want to split
up equity.

As important as this decision is, founders often don't have a good framework for making it. Here is the framework I
recommend. It has just two rules<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>.

1)  Founders who will be working on the company full-time should get equal or nearly equal amounts of equity.

2)  Founders who will be leaving their job to work on the company full-time should get much more equity than founders
    who are going to remain in academia. Academic cofounders should typically own no more than 10% unless they are going
    to continue to be hands-on<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>.

My colleague Michael Seibel previously wrote a [great
essay](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5x-how-to-split-equity-among-co-founders) about why rule \#1 is so important.
Rule \#2 is important because it is the full-time founders who will invest years of their life exclusively in making the
company successful, and they need to have enough ownership that it makes sense for them to do that.

The biggest conceptual mistake I see scientific founding teams make here is that they think the purpose of allocating
equity is to reward past contributions, when actually it‚Äôs mainly to anticipate future ones.

Here's a blunt fact about starting a company. If you are going to make a new company successful, you will probably have
to work on it for 7-10 years post spin-out. That's a long time\!

If you are just spinning out of a university now, you might feel like you're halfway done, but actually you are on
mile 2 of a 26 mile marathon. The academic founders may have been instrumental in the first mile, but it is the
full-time founders who will be primarily taking you the other 25. The equity split between founders has to reflect the
expected contributions over the whole marathon.

One consequence of this is that your equity split in the new company will not necessarily have any relation to your
seniority within the original academic team. It‚Äôs often the case that the people leaving are more junior, while the
senior people / faculty remain. In that case, the founders who leave will end up with much more equity than their former
boss. This can be an awkward conversation, but it‚Äôs entirely sensible.

## Negotiating with tech transfer offices

If you are going to commercialize research started at a university, you will probably need to negotiate the rights to
the intellectual property. The group at a university that does that is the technology transfer
office.<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>

In the past, tech transfer offices had a well-deserved bad reputation. They were known for being slow and bureaucratic,
and for forcing onerous terms onto fragile young startups. Many times the terms they insisted on strangled the very
companies they were trying to create. There was so little transparency in the industry, it was hard for founders to know
what terms were fair.

Fortunately, things have gotten better. There is now much more information available for founders. Tech transfer groups
at the universities in major startup hubs like Harvard, MIT and Stanford now give startups reasonable terms (though they
still take too long to do it). At universities that have not seen many successful spin-outs, it's hit-or-miss. A few
universities are now using ‚Äú[express](https://ctl.cornell.edu/entrepreneurs/fasttrack/) [license
agreements](https://techtransfercentral.com/2013/10/28/how-five-ttos-are-using-express-licenses-successfully/)‚Äù, preset
agreements that require little to no negotiation; hopefully this will become more common.

There are typically four key terms<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> in these agreements.

1)  Equity. Typically the university will get equity in the company. This is ok as long as it is not too much. 3-5% is
    typical. Above 10% will cause problems.<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>,
    <sup id="footnoteid6"><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>

2)  Royalty. This means that you pay a percentage of revenue or profits to the university. If this is too high, it can
    affect the viability of the company to raise money and operate. Ideally you would make this zero. If you can't do
    that, try to keep it \< 5%, and to have it terminate after a certain number of years and/or a certain level of
    payments.

3)  Milestone payments. I.e., "You owe us $250K when the company raises its first $10M", or ‚ÄúYou owe us $500K when you
    reach Phase II clinical trials‚Äù. Because cash is scarce in the early days of a startup, you want to keep these as
    low as possible. You should never need to spend more than a few percent of the money you raise.

4)  Exclusivity. If a license is not exclusive, the university could theoretically turn around and license the same IP
    to a big company to go compete with you. This sounds like a real problem, but often it‚Äôs not. For many inventions,
    in practice other companies won‚Äôt know how to use the IP and won‚Äôt value it until you've done years of work further
    developing it (at which point the university-owned IP isn‚Äôt
    sufficient).<sup id="footnoteid7"><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> It may be optimal to have a non-exclusive license
    initially with an option to make it exclusive later, or a right of first refusal clause.  
    Here is some advice for negotiating these agreements.

You should get in touch with founders of other companies that have recently negotiated agreements with the same office.
Find out what terms they got and ask for advice on negotiating strategy. You can also ask investors, lawyers, and
advisors. You should get as many data points as possible.

If you‚Äôre a student or post doc, it‚Äôs valuable to have the buy-in of the professor running your lab. Professors have
sway at universities and will give you leverage over a stubborn tech transfer office. You also want to make sure that
they don‚Äôt have any competing plans to do their own spin-out with the technology. Often by getting them onboard as an
advisor early, they will be helpful in securing a good deal, and they‚Äôll also give you credibility with investors.

If the agreement feels too onerous, ask yourself if you need it at all. It might be cheaper to recreate something
similar on the company‚Äôs time.<sup id="footnoteid8"><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>

More dramatically, you might end up not even using what you‚Äôre planning to license, because startups pivot all the time.
I‚Äôve worked with many companies that fought tooth and nail over their tech transfer agreement, only to find that a year
later they'd totally changed their approach and abandoned the IP they fought so hard to license\! One way to protect
against this is to ensure that any royalties are directly tied to the use of the technology.

Consider taking an option to license the IP in the future, rather than negotiating a full license agreement now. An
option is often much cheaper and simpler to get, and allows you to defer the final negotiation for six to twelve months.
That also gives you time to see how much you are using the original IP before committing to licensing it.

Beware of well-meaning but bad advice from university entrepreneurship offices. Some entrepreneurship offices at
universities are great, but unfortunately some are not. Worse, some have their own agendas, like helping local
investors. Consider whether the people you‚Äôre talking to have a track record of many truly successful companies when
listening to their advice.

Start the conversation with this office as early as possible. This will give you more time to work out an agreement and
also let you find out the lay of the land.

Don't wait for the agreement to start the company. Getting an agreement can take 6 months or longer. Many investors
(including YC) will fund companies before they have an agreement in place. The more progress you make on the company,
the more leverage you have in the negotiation.

## After the spinout

You‚Äôll need to incorporate your company. If you are based in the US (and possibly even if you aren‚Äôt), you‚Äôll want to
incorporate as a Delaware C Corporation, no matter which state you are physically
in.<sup id="footnoteid9"><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>

It may well make sense to continue collaborating with your lab. They may produce new work which you want to license.

In some cases, you may want to continue doing experimental work using university labs. University core facilities are
commonly available to companies, albeit for higher fees. It‚Äôs possible to save a lot of money using university resources
instead of buying equivalents commercially. That‚Äôs fine, as long as it isn‚Äôt slowing you down significantly and doesn‚Äôt
create IP issues. Unfortunately there is often a tradeoff between speed and cost.

A big adjustment for founders from academia is internalizing a different incentive structure. In academia, you‚Äôre
rewarded for new discoveries and for publications. In startups, there is zero reward for new discoveries and hardly any
for publications. In startups, the only thing that you are rewarded for is making tangible progress towards a
commercially valuable product.

A side effect is that in startups, there is no intrinsic reward for doing something new or difficult. Any time there is
a shortcut where you can copy or buy something that already exists, you should take it. In startups, you want the ‚Äúnew
part‚Äù of what you are doing to be as small as possible, and everything else to be as boring and low risk as possible.

Another big adjustment is the pace. In startups, you are racing against the clock. If you don‚Äôt hit milestones before
your current funding runs out, your company will run out of money and die. That kind of hard constraint forces focus
like nothing else. As a result, founders who leave academia to do YC often tell us they got more done in the three month
YC batch than the prior year.

If that‚Äôs made startups sound stressful, they are, if only because so much is at stake. When you‚Äôre starting your own
company, the highs are higher and the lows are lower than any regular job. If you want to learn more about what it feels
like, there‚Äôs a great essay called ‚Äú[What Startups Are Really Like](http://paulgraham.com/really.html)‚Äù.

There has [never been a better time](https://blog.samaltman.com/hard-startups) to start a biotech or hard-tech company.
There is [far more funding available](#footnoteid9) now than ever before, and a well developed ecosystem to support
founders at every stage. Today most grad students and postdocs choose between staying in academia and getting a job in
industry. We think there will increasingly be a third option: to start their own company.

**Thanks**  
I couldn‚Äôt have written this without the help of many YC founders who did spin-outs themselves. Special thanks to Uri
Lopatin, Birgitt Boschitsch, Aaron Lazarus, Alexis Rovner, Juan Medina, Glenn Markov, John Ramunas, Wesley Wiersen,
Lindsay Amos, Ravi Pamnani, and Andrew Jajack for reading drafts of this.

## Notes

<b id="footnote1">1.</b> Separately, it‚Äôs also very important for all founders to have a [vesting
schedule](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/equity) for their shares. It should vest over at least four
years.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid1)  
<b id="footnote2">2.</b> Being ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù means more than giving advice. It means spending at least 1 day / week doing
active work for the company - writing grants, being in the lab, going to sales meetings, etc. Their equity vesting
should be tied to them continuing to take a hands-on role.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid2)  
<b id="footnote3">3.</b> The names vary a little - sometimes it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúoffice of technology licensing‚Äù, or the
‚Äúinnovation office‚Äù, but I‚Äôll use this term.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid3)  
<b id="footnote4">4.</b> Here are some less critical but still common terms and quick advice for them: (5) patent
prosecution - you should have control of the patent filing and patent strategy, (6) sublicensing - likely important for
you to be able to sublicense, (7) funding requirements - try to avoid, (8) upfront and annual fees - ok if relatively
small, (9) rights to future IP coming out of the same lab - may or may not be worth it, (10) pro rata rights so the
university can invest to maintain their ownership - acceptable if the university can decide quickly and if it only
applies to priced rounds, not convertible securities.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid4)  
<b id="footnote5">5.</b> Sometimes the terms call for a ‚Äúpercentage of proceeds from any liquidity event‚Äù instead. This
is worse than equity because it can‚Äôt be diluted. So if your university insists on this because they can‚Äôt accept
equity, it should be a very small percentage, about ‚Öì of the equivalent equity percentage.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid5)  
<b id="footnote6">6. </b> Another wrinkle is anti-dilution clauses where these equity percentages don‚Äôt dilute until
you‚Äôve raised $xM.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid6)  
<b id="footnote7">7.</b> Related to this, some universities require a ‚Äúmarketing period‚Äù where they shop the invention
around to other potential buyers but usually this is a formality because they rarely get interest.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid7)  
<b id="footnote8">8.</b> Also, if you have a reasonable path to recreating it, that can give you leverage over a tech
transfer office. If they know you are busily working on recreating it, the value of the license deal goes down every
day.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid8)

talking to users. However, as you start to hire people and build a team, there are HR fundamentals worth investing in.
Having basic HR practices in place can help your startup scale quickly and may eliminate unforeseen and often costly
problems down the road.

## The People Person

Many founders ask me ‚Äúwhen is the right time to hire a HR person?‚Äù. My recommendation is around 20-30 employees or after
a Series A round. Bringing on a dedicated HR person earlier than this may make sense for some companies if they intend
to scale their workforce quickly or for other reasons; for example, a non-exempt workforce that needs managing. (See
below for more information on ‚Äúclassification.‚Äù)

In the absence of dedicated HR, there should be someone on your team acting as your ‚Äúpeople person.‚Äù This person is not
a founder and acts as a sounding board or liaison for your team. Having a people person that your team can come to and
voice their concerns is important. This person should have good judgment, be intuitive, and know when to escalate
issues. It is not their job to solve HR issues, but rather to receive feedback from your team and keep a pulse on
cultural issues that may be brewing.

This is not to say employees should not be encouraged to speak with their founder(s), though often employees are not
comfortable doing so and need another outlet. Providing your team with multiple ways to voice their concerns may help
you resolve issues faster and promote a culture of transparency and open feedback.

## Hiring

There is little need in the early stages to have a robust hiring regime, however, a few hiring fundamentals can go a
long way.

First, appointing a person to manage your hiring pipeline and keep candidates moving through each phase of the hiring
process is a good idea. Your hiring experience provides insight into your company culture and a positive candidate
experience may be the reason a candidate accepts one offer over another. For those candidates who are unsuccessful,
closing the loop with them is important and shows that you respect their time and appreciate their interest in your
company.

Second, create a hiring plan and formulate a set of questions for each interviewer during the onsite. Too often the same
surface level questions are asked over and over again when there's no internal interview plan. Each interviewer should
play a role in the hiring process and deep dive into different areas of the candidate assessment for eg. culture fit,
soft skill assessment, technical assessment, management approach, working style, and communication.

## Classification

In recent years, the classification of personnel has been a hot topic. It is important that your workforce is classified
correctly. Classification categories include regular full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees that are
either exempt or non-exempt. Other classification categories include W2 employee versus 1099 contractors and
consultants. YC company [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) has some helpful information on its Help Center regarding [Employee
Classification
Options](https://support.gusto.com/team-management/team-payments/pay-rates/1001671771/Employee-classification-options.htm).
The CA EDD also has a [worksheet](https://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de38.pdf) to determine if a worker is most likely
an employee or independent contractor.

Misclassification can be a costly mistake with potential back payment and penalties. Keep in mind that there are
specific laws for nonexempt workforces pertaining to meal breaks, overtime, and holiday pay that your company must
adhere to despite the size of your team.

## Payroll & Benefits

Employee benefits are a big overhead expense for startups. In the early stages, you don‚Äôt have to offer a full suite of
employee benefits from day one, though keep in mind that quality benefits are a drawcard for many potential candidates.

TIP: Offer a silver or gold tier base plan with an optional buy-up plan. Often startups pay 100% of premiums for a base
plan (generally a silver or gold tier plan) and give employees the option to enroll in a higher tier plan, with the
additional cost of the premium paid by the employee. This approach helps startups anticipate their employer costs while
giving flexibility to employees.

As for payroll, keep it simple. I‚Äôm a big fan of providers such as [Gusto](https://gusto.com/),
[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/) and [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/) that administer both payroll and
benefits in one portal. When assessing payroll and benefit providers, look at the amount of backend administration
needed, available integrations such as 401(k), Flexible Spending Accounts and bookkeeping services, and the tools
available to employees such as dashboards, calculators and online support.

## Company Handbook

A company handbook outlines the policies and procedures that govern your company. It outlines policies such as paid sick
leave, paid time off, parental leave and other state and federal mandated laws. An acknowledgment form is signed by each
employee, confirming that the employee 1) received the handbook, 2) has read and understands the contents of the
handbook and 3) will adhere to the policies in the handbook.

TIP: Outside legal firms often provide free company handbook templates to their clients. The template forms the basis
for your handbook and can be easily customized. YC Company Human Interest has a free [Startup Employee Handbook
template](https://humaninterest.com/blog/startup-employee-handbook-template/) available on its site and note handbook
examples from Zappos, Valve and The Motley Fool.

## Onboarding Process

Outlining a clear onboarding process from when a candidate accepts an offer to joining your company will provide a
positive introduction and get your new employees up and running quickly. Some startups use an ‚ÄúOnboarding Guide‚Äù to help
educate their new employees. An Onboarding Guide outlines all the need-to-know items such as what internal tools the
team uses, team Slack channels, where to find important information, employee benefits, perks and where to find the
snacks (always important).

Hub has published [The Ultimate Guide for Onboarding for Lean
Startups](https://blog.thehub.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-employee-onboarding-for-lean-startups/) including helpful
tips, tools and a timeline for successful onboarding.

## Terminations

It‚Äôs inevitable that you will have people leave your company, whether voluntary or involuntary. It is important to have
a process for offboarding to ensure the employee that is leaving receives their final paycheck (including all
reimbursements, commissions, bonuses, etc), company equipment is returned and IP is protected. A separation agreement
outlines the conditions of the termination and may include a separation amount. It is a good idea to use your legal
counsel for guidance and ensure your separation agreement is updated according to the specific situation at hand.

Lastly, exit interviews are a good way to get insight into your company culture and areas that need more attention.
Sometimes the feedback from exit interviews can be good, bad or downright ugly. Despite the type of feedback, having
data points and examples of positive or negative aspects of your company is a big plus and may help you make important
changes.

experiences are forced to adapt. Beyond the social networks we already know and use, we are finding new ways to
integrate social into our online lives. At Y Combinator, we are considering what this might mean for the future of
e-commerce. For several years, we have had our eye on Pinduoduo as an interesting case study. But now, as China is
recovering from the impact of COVID-19, Pinduoduo and their social-shopping approach is even better poised to fully
capture the offline-to-online transition in commerce. The success of Pinduoduo in China suggests there is a huge
opportunity for social commerce platforms to emerge in other regions.

**But first, a bit of background**

When Pinduoduo launched in 2015, there was little room for a new commerce platform in China. Two major e-commerce
platforms, JD and Taobao/TMall (sub brands of Alibaba), dominated online commerce in China, much like Amazon dominates
in the US. During that same year, JD and Taobao generated a combined $433B of gross merchandise
value.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> And yet, five years later, Pinduoduo is defying
expectations, skyrocketing from a start-up to
a 57<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>-billion-dollar-company with an active buyer base of 585
million that generated over $144B of Gross Merchandise Value in the last twelve
months.<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> In 2020, it is China‚Äôs second largest e-commerce platform
on an active user basis only lagging behind Alibaba.

Pinduoduo found room in e-commerce, not as a competitor to search-based websites like JD, but as a new e-commerce
platform focused on interactive and social shopping experiences online. Social shopping may seem like a new concept, but
the reality is that in the physical world, shopping is meant to be ‚Äúinteractive and fun‚Äù and purchases are regularly
informed by friends and family. Consider how much harder it feels to purchase a new clothing item without immediate
feedback from friends. E-commerce platforms like JD, Alibaba, and Amazon don‚Äôt account for this. Instead, they optimize
for efficiency, funnel conversion, and purchase rates. Pinduoduo, on the other hand, has tried to mimic the offline
shopping experience online by building community via their team purchase model, driving engagement via fun and
interactive games and rewards, and offering personalized experiences and value via recommendations.

Consumers‚Äô desire for social engagement while shopping is highlighted by sales within categories. Only 29% of
apparel, 11% of health & personal care, and 3% of food & beverage purchases were expected to happen online in 2020 in
the US (compared to 55% and 43% of books/music and computers/electronics purchases,
respectively<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>). These numbers reveal a missing element in
e-commerce. Social shopping is particularly important for categories where consumers seek feedback or recommendations
from friends. Pinduoduo is one of the first companies to successfully create a social shopping experience online, and
has accelerated the transition of commerce from offline to online in China.

In our view, Pinduoduo‚Äôs rapid success in social commerce will be replicated by others globally, which will continue to
drive commerce in social-driven categories online. And so, to understand the success of Pinduoduo is to understand the
future of global e-commerce.

**Creating Community via Team Purchase**

The core of the Pinduoduo experience is team purchase, where buyers form a group in order to receive discounts from
suppliers. The user experience, as laid out in the graphic below, is as follows: (1) for each item, merchants decide two
prices ‚Äì one for individual purchase and one for team purchase. If the user opts for a team purchase, he or she may
either (2.1) initiate a team purchase, or (2.2) join an existing team purchase. If the user has initiated a team
purchase, he or she may use social platforms such as WeChat to proactively encourage friends to join their team (3.1) or
more passively wait for other buyers to join the purchase on the Pinduoduo (Pinduoduo) platform (3.2). A team needs to
be formed within 24 hours to have the order confirmed. Once a team is formed, the purchase is confirmed and the product
is shipped within 48 hours.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PDD-Overview.jpg" alt="" width="1004" height="495" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104308" />

Nearly all Pinduoduo transactions are completed using team purchase. In the early days, the size of many groups was
large (e.g., 10+), but as Pinduoduo has scaled the group size requirements have declined. Team purchase is beneficial to
both buyers and manufacturers; buyers benefit from better prices for goods they want and sellers benefit from increased
demand and better visibility of future demand. In addition to driving down prices, team purchase helps solve the ‚Äútrust
deficit‚Äù of retail in China‚Äôs developing cities, where more
than 80%<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>) of retail is unorganized and consumers rely heavily on
social recommendations to initiate transactions.

Pinduoduo‚Äôs team purchase is often compared to Groupon in the US because they both enable a form of group buying. But
the models are actually very different. First, Pinduoduo deals are designed by sellers, but initiated by consumers
(i.e., users must create or join a group of a certain size to access a deal) whereas Groupon deals are designed and
managed by sellers. Second, Pinduoduo‚Äôs team purchase is used for everyday goods (e.g., fruits/vegetables, apparel) that
are valuable to consumers vs. one-off products/experiences that haven‚Äôt sold well elsewhere. Third, products on
Pinduoduo are offered by geographically diverse merchants from across China and increasingly from all over the world.
This is in contrast to the mostly local sellers that leverage Groupon to drive customers to their stores/locations. This
results in a much stronger consumer value proposition as users are getting discounts on goods they might need to
purchase anyway vs. letting sellers dictate discounts by aggregating demand on low-value goods or excess inventory.

To maximize this effect, Pinduoduo launched in the fruits and vegetables category. This was strategic for two
reasons: 1) incumbents were focused on non-perishable items, so competition was limited and 2) fruits and vegetables are
lower order value, high frequency goods, which means users had a reason to use Pinduoduo regularly. When potential
buyers saw a great deal they would forward it to their neighbors and friends via WeChat to create a team of 10+ buyers
to be able to purchase the product. In return, the group initiator would get produce for free as they helped Pinduoduo
acquire 10 incremental users. Because team purchase drove organic sharing of the product, Pinduoduo was able to grow its
user base very quickly. Only one month after launching their first party application in January 2016 (transactions prior
to this happened via WeChat), Pinduoduo already had over 10 million customers. Only four years later, Pinduoduo has
grown to 585M active buyers. To compare, Alibaba crossed the 500M active buyer threshold 14-15 years after launching its
consumer facing marketplace vs. just 4 years for Pinduoduo. The take away for startups is that the team purchase model
is significant because it enables behaviors associated with offline commerce (e.g., sharing products or ideas with
friends, browsing a shopping mall with friends) in an online setting. Team Purchase helped Pinduoduo grow quickly and
create a unique recommendation engine based on users‚Äô social interactions. While Team Purchase may be unique to China
today, we expect social e-commerce to be global. New commerce platforms that can leverage social relationships will
accelerate the offline to online transition and if you are able to tap into groups of social relationships vs.
one-to-one relationship the faster your platforms will scale. PDD has one of the most powerful network effects in the
world ([Reed‚Äôs law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law): The value of a group-forming network is proportional to
number and the ease with which groups form within it. Think Slack, WhatsApp Groups -- they all grew exponentially as
they could tap into groups of social relationships)

While Team Purchase was the main reason for Pinduoduo‚Äôs rapid growth, a significant enabler of Pinduoduo‚Äôs virality was
the widespread use of WeChat as a platform in China. Tencent (WeChat‚Äôs owner) is a large investor in Pinduoduo, and as a
result was happy to let Pinduoduo grow on top of their ecosystem. We think it is highly unlikely that Facebook would
allow a social commerce application like Pinduoduo to be built on top of Messenger or Instagram in the US. That said,
messaging is fragmented in the US, so this is not an issue for US-based social e-commerce companies.

Users visit Pinduoduo without any specific intent, much like visiting a real-world shopping mall. In a shopping mall,
the time that a consumer spends at the mall directly correlates with the amount he or she buys. As such, Pinduoduo has
gamified the experience to maximize the amount of time a user spends on the app irrespective of whether they make a
purchase or not. The primary features/experiences that have incentivized sharing and usage are Daily Check-Ins, Price
Cuts, Card Programs, and Mini Games. Social commerce does not just mean connecting user accounts to Facebook. It means
investing in creating physical world experiences online -- specifically bringing the fun of shopping offline to online
platforms. We will walk through how Pinduoduo has implemented this below.

**Daily check-ins**

The daily check-in is a feature, prominently featured in the center of the home page. It encourages daily usage by
rewarding users with redeemable points each time he or she checks into Pinduoduo. The user experience is laid out in the
image below. First, the user clicks the yellow icon to administer a check-in. Each time the user checks-in they are
granted a small amount of money and/or credit. Over many months (and many check-ins), these rewards accumulate. In the
example below, the user has accumulated 26.6 RMB of rewards. To cash out in the form of a no minimum spend voucher, the
user has to reach a certain minimum value (i.e., 30 RMB).

The daily check-in is a simple yet brilliant feature that encourages users to engage with Pinduoduo on a daily basis.
While each check-in does not generate revenue for Pinduoduo, the product experience eventually ties back to commerce
if/when users redeem their vouchers. This theoretically should yield a higher customer lifetime value for Pinduoduo.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104298" />

**Price Chop**

Price Chop is a feature that allows users to get products for free by sharing a custom link with their friends. The
feature is outlined in detail below. Once in the Price Chop section of Pinduoduo, the user selects the goods that they
want for free. Upon selection, a 24 hour timer begins. To get the item for free, the user must share their link with as
many friends as possible. Every friend that clicks on the link and engages with Pinduoduo (no purchase required) drives
an incremental discount for the initiator. If you don't reduce the price to 0 within 24 hours you don't get the item for
free and you have to start all over again\!

The product mimics the experience of ‚Äúleveling‚Äù in a massive online multiplayer game like World of Warcraft whereby it
becomes harder to level up as you graduate to higher levels. In the case of Pinduoduo, the difficulty is customized
based on the user (i.e., easier for low-engagement users) and the item (i.e., expensive items are more difficult to
chop). Additionally, similar to leveling, as you get closer to 0 (i.e., a higher level) each incremental friend that
engages with your link grants smaller and smaller discounts.

Similar to Daily Check-In, Price Chop encourages users to engage with Pinduoduo, and eventually ties the engagement to
an order on the commerce platform. But unlike Daily Check-In, Price Chop incentivizes users to share Pinduoduo with
their social network. So in addition to increasing customer lifetime value, Price Chop also helps Pinduoduo efficiently
acquire customers via user-user sharing of the product.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104299" />

**Card Program**

Pinduoduo‚Äôs card program is designed to encourage users to share the product amongst friends and to save money via
vouchers/special discounts. Pinduoduo has created several different cards that either (1) encourage certain user
behaviors or (2) provide utility to a Pinduoduo user. The three most popular cards are the Free Pass Card, the Black
Brand Card, and the Brand Card.

The Free Pass Card is similar to a loyalty program where users can enjoy a ‚Äúteam purchase discount‚Äù without having to
join a team. Users usually get one Free Pass Card after making two purchases on Pinduoduo.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104300" />

The Brand Black Card encourages users to leave reviews on the platform by offering them a discount on branded products
in return. Pinduoduo gives users a Brand Black Card after they have posted 2 - 4 reviews on the website. This is
important as consumers rely on reviews and recommendations from previous buyers when making purchase decisions. The
Brand Black Card incentivizes a good user behavior that makes the platform better for the entire user base.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104301" />

The Brand Card aims to promote Pinduoduo‚Äôs branded products. Consumers get a Brand Card after they have made a purchase
on Pinduoduo. They can share their brand cards with friends via WeChat, to attract their friends to browse and buy
branded products from Pinduoduo. It is an effective way to encourage users to buy branded products they would not
normally buy because the recommendation/card was sent to them by a trusted friend.

This is also important because Pinduoduo has historically been used to primarily buy non-branded products. The Brand
Card is an effective incentive mechanism to increase Pinduoduo‚Äôs branded product market share in China.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104302" />

**Mini Games**

Pinduoduo wants users to engage with the platform as often as possible, and they want the experience to mimic real-world
shopping. As such, they want users to engage with the app to have fun, even if it does not immediately translate into a
purchase. Pinduoduo now hosts in-app games to help drive up daily time spent on the platform. The first popular game on
Pinduoduo was Duo Duo Orchard. Think of Farmville except now the rewards are real physical goods. The game is simple ‚Äì a
user creates and nurtures a virtual fruit tree to eventually yield a real box of fruit shipped to his or her address. It
already has more than 11M DAUs\!

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104303" />

Though not multiplayer, Orchard has social cooperation aspects that drive up network engagement as well. Once users
choose a tree to create (e.g., mango, lemon, macadamia nut), they need to nurture the tree with water and fertilizer.
The more you shop on Pinduoduo the more water droplets you receive to nurture your tree. To encourage more interactions
with friends, you can also share the water droplets. Team purchases and sharing product links enables users to obtain
special tools like a water can, decorations for your orchard, or bags of fertilizer, which accelerate the growth of your
tree. Pinduoduo is expanding its in app game selection. It recently launched DD Bank, a piggy bank game where users
accumulate exchangeable coins over time.

Games like Duo Duo Orchard and DD Bank are ingenious because progress or ‚Äúleveling‚Äù is tied to behaviors that drive
financial goals for the company. By encouraging users to play games on Pinduoduo, they are able to create a win-win-win
situation for merchants, consumers, and themselves. More specifically, merchants see more volume, consumers have fun and
receive unique discounts, and Pinduoduo generates revenue.

**Creating Value by Offering Personalized Recommendations**

Lastly, unlike search-based platforms, Pinduoduo is highly personalized and recommendation based. This means that users
visit Pinduoduo without any specific intent, much like visiting a shopping mall in the physical world. Based on
information such as who a user‚Äôs friends are, what their favorite categories are, and which of their friend‚Äôs they
trust, Pinduoduo can make recommendations that are personalized to each user. Pinduoduo is uniquely positioned to do
this due to user-user sharing of the product caused by Team Purchase. The data aggregated by the platform allows the
company to optimize what items a user encounters on the app by highlighting (1) products that trusted friends have
already purchased or recommended and (2) products in a users‚Äô favorite categories. For new customers, the standard
practice is to show new users different categories (based on what they know about that user and their friends) and see
how they interact with those categories. This is then used to create your buying persona and helps inform future product
recommendations.

Beyond offering personalized product recommendations, Pinduoduo also thinks about value-for-money as a personalizable
concept. Based on a user‚Äôs purchase/browsing history, Pinduoduo knows whether a user values high-cost branded clothing
or low-cost non-branded clothing. Based on a user‚Äôs specific buying persona, Pinduoduo will only show you clothing items
that match your willingness to pay.

**The Future of Global E-Commerce**

There is a huge opportunity for companies to build social into their commerce platforms to take share from transactional
platforms and expand e-commerce‚Äôs overall share of spend. The success of team purchase may be specific to the commercial
landscape of China, but the insights Pinduoduo has surfaced about social integration in commerce is likely entirely
universal. Going forward, when building their products, founders should consider the insight that shopping is a social
activity. Web 1.0 platforms - including Amazon - optimize for efficiency and don‚Äôt serve trust-based categories very
well. We firmly believe that by building sharing use cases and fun experiences that mimic the fun of real-world shopping
into products, commerce‚Äôs offline to online transition will accelerate.

There are large indicators that there is major demand for more sophisticated social commerce in the US marketplace
already. An obvious example of this is Instagram, which has over one billion users and is now, arguably, one of the
world‚Äôs largest social shopping platforms. Similarly to Pinduoduo, Instagram has fostered a browsing-based feed from
friends and influencers of things that might interest consumers, often accompanied with links to purchase. The rise of
the social media influencer economy alone shows that US consumers are ready to fully engage in social online shopping.

In fact, we have already seen a few companies come through Y Combinator who are trying to fill this void.
[Snackpass](https://www.snackpass.co/), a food app for college campuses, has built social experiences into their
product. Students can send gifts to each other or hatch virtual pets together by ordering food via the app. These
interactive experiences encourage increased usage of the company‚Äôs product. [Meesho](https://meesho.com/), a reseller
marketplace in India, lets its customers create microbusinesses by selling products/goods to their friends and family
via Whatsapp and other messaging channels.

Companies like Amazon will continue to grow in market share, for specific shopping needs. But it is inevitable that
something will rise to fill the e-commerce-social browsing void in the US market. And the half-hearted attempts some
retail platforms are making to bridge that gap are not yet cutting it. Social commerce does not just mean connecting
user accounts to Facebook, it means creating new shopping experiences for buyers and sellers online.

Meanwhile Pinduoduo‚Äôs social commerce is only gaining sophistication and market influence. Pinduoduo has already
aggregated enough consumer insights that they are able to collaborate with and influence manufacturers in China to cater
to their user base. If there is a gap in the US e-commerce market, it is not just an opportunity to grow domestic online
retail. As the pandemic drives the worlds' social lives to the Internet, there is an undeniable opportunity for
companies to build social into their commerce platforms to accelerate the offline to online transition globally.

fear and uncertainty.

What if I told you that being a great enterprise salesperson requires the same skill set as being a great hacker? You
just need to reframe how you think about sales.

Before I get started, I want to point out that this article is focused on early stage companies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose who are still in
the "wild west" stage of figuring things out and do not yet have an established repeatable sales process and
organization. That said, I assume you have found product-market fit, or are close to
it.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

Hackers are experts at understanding complex systems and bending them to their
will.<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Large enterprise sales requires the same skill set, but
applied to a different kind of system.<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> Where a computer system is
a complex network of **hardware and software**, a large enterprise is a complex network of **people and
processes**‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it can be understood and influenced in the same way. The emergent behavior of a corporation is
the result of incentives and structured rules amongst its constituent people, much like the output of a computer system
is the result of structured rules and data flows between pieces of code.

Enterprise sales, then, involves understanding and influencing the components (people) of the system in order to produce
the desired behavior (buying your product.) Every system (company) is different, and so you need to develop a systematic
approach to hacking (selling to) them.

This is especially true in the early stages of a startup.‚ÄäA mature company has generally figured out how to hack most of
the possible systems in its target market and has created scripted processes to make it a rinse-and-repeat sales model.
To follow the analogy through, in this way you can consider the typical "coin operated" sales person at a mature company
to be more akin to a [script kiddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) than a hacker.

Usually the more complex the system, the more satisfaction the hacker feels when he or she pwns it. Great news:
Enterprise sales systems are really complex, and hacking them can be much more difficult than hacking computer systems.
This is because the components don‚Äôt always operate according to structured, rational rules. They are humans with
emotions, which means you also have to understand their motivations, hopes and fears. If that additional chaos isn‚Äôt
enough, consider that the feedback cycle is much slower when hacking an enterprise vs. hacking a computer system. This
means you need to be much more methodical in your approach -- brute force is generally not an option -- and you don‚Äôt
have as many chances to make mistakes.

Below I will offer some tips on hacking the enterprise. But first, it‚Äôs useful to point out some of the typical objects
(people) you can expect to encounter in the system and their respective incentives and concerns:

  - **Champion.** A champion is your ally within the target company. He or she will have have deep familiarity with the
    pain your product solves, and will hope that your product is the solution. When you give your pitch, you will find
    the champion nodding along and completing your sentences for you.
    
    The champion will do everything he or she can to get your product deployed at the company, but their influence
    depends on their seniority and authority. While line-level champions are great, you also need to find champions who
    are director-level and above. Champions may become so excited they will want to quit and join your company (it has
    happened to me multiple times), and in any case, a champion often acts as if they are one of your employees‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey
    are your guy/gal on the inside.
    
    These people are gold. Find them early and build strong relationships quickly.

  - **Detractor.** The opposite of a champion is a detractor. For some reason, these folks really don‚Äôt want to see your
    solution deployed at the company. Maybe it threatens their job. Maybe they are already invested in a competing
    product. Maybe they built the solution that is currently being used. Figure out who these folks are early, and
    generally try to stay off their radar. You need to rally enough support from champions and other parts of the
    organization to overpower any detractors.

  - **IT.** There are two types of IT organizations you may run into: The risk avoidant organization that perceives
    change as threatening and risky for the business, and thus shies away from it, and the forward-thinking IT
    organization that is programmed for risk taking and embracing change. Unfortunately, the former is a lot more common
    than the latter at large enterprises, and for this reason it‚Äôs usually a good strategy to avoid talking to IT
    (unless your product‚Äôs users are in IT.) It‚Äôs usually easier to get a meeting with IT compared to a business unit,
    but be warned, these meetings can end up leading you astray. Some IT groups don‚Äôt actually understand the true needs
    of the business‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôve been burned by this in the past, building features that IT have asked for in order to get a
    deal done only to discover when putting the product in front of actual users that it wasn‚Äôt what they wanted.
    
    Your strategy should generally be to avoid IT until required to go through security reviews and other approvals, and
    by this time you should have the business units "pulling" you so strongly that IT can‚Äôt slow things down for too
    long. There are of course exceptions to every rule. I have worked with some phenomenal IT people in the past who
    ended up being real champions and helping us get deployed across different parts of the business.

  - **Procurement.** If you are lucky enough to convince a decision maker/budget holder to buy your product, you will
    usually be handed over to procurement to negotiate the deal. Get ready for some pain, because usually these folks
    are incentivized to get the lowest price possible (though there are always exceptions.) Just make sure you are
    prepared to "give" them something‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonce they extract their pound of flesh they will get out of the way. This is one
    reason why a lot of enterprise software has a ridiculously high "list price", but discounting by 80% or more is
    standard practice.

  - **Legal.** As you run the gauntlet you will likely encounter legal next. Their weapon of choice is often
    exhaustion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsending back endless redlines over clauses in the contract that in reality won‚Äôt have much impact.
    Your best strategy here is to decide up front what you really care about and what you are willing to give on.
    
    After you‚Äôve done a round or two of redlines, a good strategy is to have a frank and authentic discussion listing
    out those things that you care about, and give in on the stuff that won‚Äôt really make a difference for you. That,
    combined with strong support from your champion (who should be in the background telling legal to hurry up and get
    the deal done), will help you close out the negotiation and get a signature.

  - **Finance.** You may not need to interact with finance directly, as they may just talk to procurement, but it‚Äôs
    important to aware of the motivations of the finance team. One thing they are thinking about is the budget and
    budget cycle. For example, you may find that the finance team prefers to pay more money up front to use up some of
    this quarter‚Äôs budget, rather than to space out payments over time. Also important is whether they have a preference
    for capex or opex, which will influence whether they prefer to make a lump sum payment for a purchase of software vs
    paying monthly license fees. This affects your pricing model as well as the structure of your sales team and comp
    plans.

-----

Now that you have some sense about what the components of the enterprise system look like here are a few tips for
hacking it:

**Uncover the motivations of every player.**

In the beginning you should devote a lot of time to listening and learning. Map out the people in your target company,
draw a diagram. Just like a great hacker spends a lot of time poking around, exploring and understanding how a system
works before attempting to influence it, you need to spend a lot of time really understanding the organization,
motivations and interactions.

**Build strong relationships with your champion(s).**

When doing a large enterprise deal it will fall through before it closes, maybe more than once. You will need to lean on
your champions to revive the deal and keep it moving. You need to turn these champions into your friends‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou should be
able to text them any time of night and ask for their help. Your champions are your best entry point into influencing
the system.

**Hire the right type of sales people.**

Now that you understand what selling to the enterprise is like, you should make sure you hire the right people given the
stage of your company. Personally I tend to optimize for skills and raw characteristics over experience. An especially
common problem is hiring the wrong fit for your stage - for example, hiring a "coin operated" script kiddie salesperson
out of a large company when you really need a hacker. You want people who are comfortable with uncertainty, who can
learn quickly, and have strong intuitive and intellectual intelligence to understand the system well enough to influence
it.

**Keep your map front and center.**

You spent time mapping out the system in advance. Now, you must always keep it in mind, especially when strange things
seem to be happening. Go back and evaluate the different people, their motivations, and their interactions. Figure out
how to play the system to your advantage, and inject the right messages in the right places. Position your product in
the right way to the right people at the right time. This is where the art of selling comes into play so I can‚Äôt give
concrete tactical advice here, other than to draw your awareness to the fact that it is where most of the magic happens
in sales.

**Engage on many fronts.**

It‚Äôs a good practice to create pairs of relationships. For example, pair executives at your company with executives at
the customer, your engineers with their IT and security folks, your product people with their business unit leaders etc.
That said, always make sure one person (usually the account executive) is overseeing and coordinating all the
interactions.

**Instrument your process.**

It‚Äôs important to instrument your sales process (collecting data and generating reports) in the same way you would use a
packet sniffer or debugger when hacking. You need to measure your sales process in order to improve it.

**Don‚Äôt forget that companies are people too.**

It may seem like one organization selling to another organization. But really, decisions are made by people, and people
don‚Äôt always act rationally. You can use this to your advantage by building the right relationships as described above,
or it can blindside you and cause a deal to blow up if you don‚Äôt have the correct understanding of the people involved
in the system. Remember that friendships lead to partnerships. Remember also that friendships often transcend the
employer. By nurturing these relationships they will pay off across multiple companies.

I hope this perspective on enterprise sales encourages more hacker founders to get out there and sell their products
more effectively.

slide decks for Demo Day.*

**Here‚Äôs how to make a solid Demo Day slide deck. The thing to remember is that you already have everything you need to
create a great presentation.**

There are probably 100 reasons why your company is great, but people can only really remember a few of them after a
short presentation or pitch. With each one of you, we sat down and figured out the 5 to 7 most important ideas people
should know about your startup. These 5 to 7 points are the ones you want investors to remember.

As you experienced for yourselves from <span id='r1'>Prototype Day</span> [1.](#e1), you‚Äôll be lucky if they can
remember even 1 or 2 of those points in the context of 100 other companies also presenting alongside you.

If you just communicate your points clearly, you‚Äôll do better than 99% of startups. Because before anyone can remember,
they have to understand. Here‚Äôs how I make things easy to understand:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.125.png" alt="ddaytips-125" width="100%" height="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097395" />

  - I make it legible.
  - I make it simple.
  - I make it obvious.

Here‚Äôs how to get people to **not** understand:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.013.png" alt="ddaytips-013" width="100%" height="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097368" />

  - Making it illegible.
  - Making it complicated.
  - Making it subtle.

I‚Äôm going to hammer this in with some repetition: Your slides should **NOT** be illegible, complicated, or subtle.
Slides should be legible, simple, and obvious.

This is when I give a word of warning before moving forward in my presentation. **This presentation has too many damn
slides.** If this was an actual Demo Day presentation, I‚Äôd have stopped a few slides ago. This is a visual essay, which
is very different. Please don‚Äôt make a visual essay.

**Legibility**

Alright, let‚Äôs talk about legible slides. If they can‚Äôt read it, they won‚Äôt be able to understand it. At Demo Day, the
room will be filled with over 500 people. They can‚Äôt all sit in the front row. A good number of them are old-ish people,
so their eyesight may not be the best.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.022.png" alt="ddaytips-022" width="100%" height="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097369" />

Legible slides are ones that even old people sitting in the back row with bad eyesight can read. Here‚Äôs how you do that:

  - Use large type.
  - Bold text.
  - A simple font.
  - With good contrast from the background.

Also, text at the top is easier to read from the back of the room. Let‚Äôs run through some examples.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.029.png" alt="ddaytips-029" width="100%" height="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097370" />

This is not exactly terrible. The problem is the contrast and the positioning of the text. Let's try it again.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.031.png" alt="ddaytips-031" width="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097371" />

It's better, but there's lots of other text on this slide that's not optimized for legibility because we've allowed the
screenshot to be a constraint. Here's a version I know everyone will be able to read from the back of the room.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.033.png" alt="ddaytips-033" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097372" />

The following slide comes from [Shred Video](http://shredvideo.com/). It's from their Prototype Day presentation
(*thanks guys for giving me permission to use this*) and it's the one that's supposed to explain what their startup is
building.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.034.png" alt="ddaytips-034" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097373" />

As you can see (or not see), the text is too small and too skinny. The text that actually explains what they do is also
at the [bottom of the slide](/images/ddaytips/ddaytips.034.png). Their technology is amazing. Shred's software can
automatically edit videos from hours of raw footage into something that looks like it was made by a professional in just
a few seconds. Unfortunately, they've basically hidden it in light gray at the bottom of the slide. By Demo Day, their
description simplified and the text they used to describe it was large and in charge.

**Simplicity**

Let‚Äôs talk about simple slides. Simple ideas are easy to understand.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.038.png" alt="ddaytips-038" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097374" />

But what does that exactly mean? Well, simple and complex share the same word origin.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.039.png" alt="ddaytips-039" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097375" />

The word ‚Äòplex‚Äô means braid or twist or fold.

Simple ideas are ones that aren‚Äôt intertwined with other ideas. They are one fold. They are one idea. A simple slide,
therefore, expresses one idea. Do not crowd your slides with multiple ideas. That‚Äôs how you make it complex. Some ideas
may take more than one slide to express a point, but you should try hard to do it in one.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.042.png" alt="ddaytips-042" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097376" />

Since you only have 5-7 ideas you want to get across to investors, you shouldn‚Äôt have too many slides. Demo Day slides
ideally have only about 5-7 slides.

Let's look at another example from one of our startups. Here‚Äôs a very early version of a slide from
[Afrostream](https://afrostream.tv/) explaining what they do.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.047.png" alt="ddaytips-047" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097377" />

They've put two ideas here trying to convey what exactly they've built and who it's for. Unfortunately, there's just too
much text here. It might have been okay if they had just put the highlighted portions, but they made a very common
mistake that I see a lot of startups make. They've tried to pack in all the little nuances of their business into this
slide. The result is a slide that no one can easily remember.

Contrast this with the slide they end up using on Demo Day to explain their startup:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/afrostream-after.jpg" alt="afrostream-after" width="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097366" />

Ahhhh, it's like a breath of fresh air. Short, sweet, and easy to recollect. Once you decide what idea you're going to
try to convey on a slide, you've got to figure out how to make sure your audience finds that idea. The best way to help
people find the one idea on each slide is to make it obvious.

**Obviousness**

Let‚Äôs talk about obvious slides. Obvious slides are ones that can be understood at a glance. Here‚Äôs a simple test you
can use to test if a slide is obvious: Show it to a stranger and ask them to tell you what it means. If they don‚Äôt
**immediately** say your idea, you lose.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.056.png" alt="ddaytips-056" width="1920"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097379" />

This is because ideas that are obvious are very fast to understand. Why do we care about the speed of understanding?
Well, for a Demo Day presentation the following two things make it very tricky for you.

1.  You only have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
2.  People are easily distracted.

In fact, investors are even more easily distracted than most other people. They are easily distracted because they are
impatient. If they don‚Äôt get your point right away, they will check their email.

We can‚Äôt force investors to stare and listen to you the entire time. And to be honest, it‚Äôs hard to focus intently on
over 100 presentations even if it‚Äôs your job. Have some empathy\! The way to mitigate this is to make sure any slide you
show can be immediately understood. That way they‚Äôll just get it when they look up from checking their email.

Here‚Äôs how I make things obvious: I start by making it **legible** and **simple**. (See two points above.) Then I try to
make my idea **explicit**. Here‚Äôs an example:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.072.png" alt="ddaytips-072" width="1920"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097380" />

markdown: That slide isn‚Äôt explicit. You can probably guess and figure out it represents some kind of growth graph, but
it isn‚Äôt immediately clear.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.074.png" alt="ddaytips-074" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097381" />

This is better, but the idea I want to express could be more in your face.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.076.png" alt="ddaytips-076" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097382" />

Boom. It's like I put CliffsNotes right on the slide. No need to guess how my startup is doing, I made it explicit.
Here‚Äôs another variation from one of our startups.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.079.png" alt="ddaytips-079" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097384" />

Without the caption, you‚Äôd have to study the graph to get to that conclusion. Just writing it out like that means I
barely have to look at the graph at all.

Another way I make my slides obvious is to avoid distractions in my slides. Now, when I say distractions, I mean
information distractions. Here‚Äôs one way to show how Dropbox works:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.084.png" alt="ddaytips-084" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097385" />

Not bad, but not obvious. The problem is people can‚Äôt understand that slide immediately. Why? Well, there‚Äôs a lot of
information on that slide. See?

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.087.png" alt="ddaytips-087" width="1920"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097386" />

All that crap takes time to comprehend. There‚Äôs actually a law of human interaction called [Hick's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law) that describes how each piece of information we add to a problem comes
at a cost‚Äì-increasing the number of choices will increase the time it takes to make a decision logarithmically.

To me, diagrams are like little mazes for ideas. It usually makes the path to the idea you want to express too long. And
you don‚Äôt want investors wasting time trying to figure out a diagram. You want investors to just understand
immediately‚Äîimmediately why you‚Äôre awesome. So the path to the idea should be straight and quick.

Here‚Äôs some other distractions you should avoid in your slides.

  - Too much text.
  - Excessive explanations and caveats.
  - Excessive branding per slide.
  - Photos with no titles or captions.
  - Animations.
  - Transitions.
  - Memes.
  - Subtle humor.
  - Accidental humor.

Basically, don‚Äôt try to make the slides the thing they‚Äôll remember.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.107.png" alt="ddaytips-107" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097390" />

Investors invest in teams not slides. Your slides should make **your** ideas more clear. Don‚Äôt let your slides distract
investors from what you‚Äôre saying out loud. You want them to be impressed by you. Not your slides.

There is, however, one exception I have for this rule: when your point is to show complexity or to overwhelm the
audience. This usually happens when a startup wants to talk about how hard a problem is that they're solving. I‚Äôll give
you an example from [Magic‚Äôs](https://getmagicnow.com/) slide deck.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.092.png" alt="ddaytips-092" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097388" />

On that slide they make the point that their software abstracts away thousands of services into a single interface. To
bring the point home, they show a slide of every on demand service they could think of in every industry, market and
vertical organized on a grid.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.093.png" alt="ddaytips-093" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097389" />

Normally, it's not ideal to show a slide of every potential competitor out on the market. The logos, however, represent
the problem. For users to take advantage of all these services, they'd have to create an account for every single one.
It's a discovery and usability issue. Each logo also represents every business Magic is now able to charge a premium on
top of to solve their users' problems. It's overwhelming for a reason and that's usually when it's okay to bend the
rules.

**Fucking Screenshots**

Let‚Äôs talk about screenshots. I usually hate screenshots in Demo Day presentations. Screenshots are almost always
illegible, complex, and non-obvious. They break all 3 rules\! The text in most interfaces are too small (not legible).
Most interfaces do multiple things (not simple). Most screenshots take longer than a glance to understand (not obvious).
They are the worst.

Here is a Google image search for
[‚Äòscreenshots‚Äô](https://www.google.com/search?q=screenshots&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIhoqquqadyQIVSfJjCh1diQB8&biw=1204&bih=1356):

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screenshots.png" alt="screenshots" width="960"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097396" />

Can you understand any of those images immediately? Nay.

If you‚Äôre trying to show what you do, I recommend showing the most simplified version of it. A bulleted list of steps is
my favorite technique for this.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.118.png" alt="ddaytips-118" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097391" />

That slide is far better at explaining the ease of use of [SparkGift's](https://www.sparkgift.com/) product than any
workflow they could show from their actual interface. Sometimes a company can get lucky and explain what they do in two
points. Here's how [Meadow](https://getmeadow.com) did it:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.119.png" alt="ddaytips-119" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097392" />

In my opinion, this slide is far better than any combination of buttons, links and chrome they could have put up there
to express the same idea.

The frustration I have for screenshots in pitch decks goes for screencasts and videos as well. Think twice before trying
to use either one.

Alright, so there‚Äôs probably a lot more you can do to improve your slide deck, but this is a pretty good start. Again,
here‚Äôs how to make a solid Demo Day slide deck:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ddaytips.125.png" alt="ddaytips-125" width="1920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097395" />

Make it legible. - Make it simple. - Make it obvious.

If you just do these three things, you‚Äôll have a presentation that anyone can probably understand. And since
understanding is the foundation for getting someone excited enough to want to talk to you afterwards, it‚Äôs a good place
to start.

Two weeks into a batch we hold an event called Prototype Day for all the startups to present to one another for the
first time. What they realize quickly is how bad they are at describing their startups in a way that gets even their
batchmates to remember. [‚Ü™](#r1)

One of the most common questions we hear from founders is ‚ÄúHow do I manage my board?‚Äù It‚Äôs something that provokes
anxiety, because this is the first time the founder/CEO is subject to external supervision, and the board has powers
that include the firing of the CEO and the senior management. It is natural to feel this way. So, in this post, I‚Äôm
sharing the collective wisdom of the YC community to help guide founders on best practices in managing a
board‚Äì‚Äìincluding running board meetings and overcoming board issues. Where possible, I‚Äôve included specific examples
- drawn from YC companies and partners - of how companies have handled board issues.

But first, what‚Äôs the purpose of a board? The main role of a board is to help guide the company through major decisions,
such as hiring and firing senior management; approving corporate actions (e.g. compensation, stock options, and budget);
and offering guidance on strategic decisions that impact the business longer term. As a legal matter, every Delaware
corporation must have a board once it starts operating. At the start, this consists of the founders and the board
functions mostly just as the technical body for approving corporate actions that must follow certain formalities (e.g.
option grants). When people refer to setting up a board, what they usually mean is the process of adding outside
directors, after the company raises money. These may be investor directors or independent directors.

### A note on board composition

If you need to have a board, who should be on it? Since the answer depends so much on the particular company and
industry, we won‚Äôt spend much time on board composition in this post, but the short answer is that the investors who
lead your Series A and Series B rounds will typically join the board (later-stage growth stage investors don‚Äôt tend to
ask for board seats).

A smaller company will have 3-5 board seats and a public company board will have 7-9 seats. The composition tends to
significantly change a few years before going public, beginning with recruiting independent board members. Later, as the
company grows, specific topical expertise committees (e.g., audit and compensation) will also be formed.

But in terms of how to pick the *right* board members - for an early stage company - the \#1 attribute you need is
trust. And the only way you build trust is with time. We recommend getting to know partners at VC firms on your list at
least 6 to 9 months before your fundraise. Mathilde Colin, the CEO of Front, shares her experience doing this
[here](https://medium.com/@collinmathilde/front-series-a-deck-f2e2775a419b).

Before you add new board members, you should have a sense of their strengths, their weaknesses, and whether you would
want to work with them for 10+ years‚Äì‚Äìthat‚Äôs how long some of these boards may last, given the median time to IPO. So,
how do you get to know who these people really are beyond spending time with them? One thing you can do is check
references with founders that those investors have worked with - just as with recruiting any talent.

Interestingly, many founders feel that this reference check and balance may be causing many VCs to be less transparent
in terms of providing feedback with the founders they work with - since they‚Äôre afraid of getting bad feedback and
losing their next investment opportunity - so a number of founders have started bringing on independents much sooner.

In their series B, Atrium founder Justin Kan added YC partner Michael Seibel‚Äì‚Äìa former co-founder of his at Justin.tv.
Similarly, the Brex founders (Henrique and Pedro) added TFG Founder/CEO Victor Lazarte, another founder from Brazil who
has known them since the age of 16. The Faire founders (Max, Marcelo, and Daniele) added Brian Grassadonia, who leads
Square Cash and was their former manager at Square. These are all examples of CEOs‚Äô desire for deeply trusted
independent board directors. Many of these relationships are likened to family relationships, where the family privately
shares the kind of direct feedback no one else will. However this does not mean you add your friend to your board. You
need someone you really trust, who is 100% independent, and has the ability to help both you and your team as you scale
the company.

## Managing Your Board

Below, I‚Äôve tried sharing our advice for managing your board - from how often to meet, to the materials you need - in
order to ensure a useful and productive group discussion.

### Meeting Schedule

At the Series A stage, most meetings tend to be informal (like 1:1s), ranging anywhere from bi-weekly to even
bi-monthly. By the time you reach the Series B stage, however, you should establish a regular meeting cadence: Every
quarter, with all meetings scheduled a year in advance to ensure all board members can attend. Ideally, only in person\!

### Agenda and length

As the CEO it is your job to set and own the agenda for the board meeting, which can last about 3 hours.

Be careful not to treat board meetings as a status update meeting, but rather as a meeting where you can openly discuss
strategic or tough topics. That‚Äôs why the best CEOs tend to allot only the first 45 mins for sharing
highlights/lowlights and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and then use the rest of the time to deep dive on no more
than 1-2 strategic topics.

Here‚Äôs an example agenda from the last board meeting I attended for Gusto (a company that offers payroll, benefits and
HR for Small and Medium Businesses)‚Äì‚Äìshared with their permission of course\!

  - Highlights / Lowlights (10 mins)
  - Performance / KPIs (50 mins)
  - Strategic topic 1: Gusto 3 Year Strategic Plan (45 mins)
  - Strategic topic 2: Engineering Org - Current and Future (45 mins)
  - Closed Session - 30 mins (e.g., Any board matters such as approvals, sensitive topics, and feedback)

What this shows is that the company spends no more than 1/3rd of the time on the state of the business, and then the
majority of the time on the strategic issues that shape its future. I also recommend identifying and aligning on key
KPIs with your board members early as it helps the company standardize reporting across board meetings. It also ‚Äútrains‚Äù
board members to efficiently process the most important ones quickly - focusing on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù (why did or didn‚Äôt you hit
certain goals?) - so they can turn to more strategic matters.

What really allows Gusto to pull off their strategic focus within their board meeting, however, happens *outside* the
board meeting: (1) They do a lot of prep work on the areas where they‚Äôre seeking input. Ideally this is a topic you‚Äôre
already discussing with your executive team so the materials can be leveraged for multiple discussions; and (2) They
send out a pre-read version of their board deck at least a week in advance, collecting questions from each board member
in a Google Doc three days before the meeting. The Gusto team then answers all those questions in the Google Doc by the
morning of the board meeting, so the subsequent discussion *inside* the board meeting can focus on the two most
strategic topics.

Getting through the entire agenda effectively requires strict time management. Consider assigning formal time-keeping
responsibilities to a rotating member in the room.

### Elements of a board deck

The board deck is just a tool for discussion, not an end in and of itself. For the principles of what goes into a board
deck, Bryan Schrier from Sequoia has a great post [here](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/preparing-a-board-deck/).

This seems obvious, but is underrated: The structure of the board deck should align with the agenda of the meeting. For
example, Gusto‚Äôs board decks are 30-50 pages long and typically have the following sections:

  - Highlights / Lowlights - 1 page
  - Performance / KPIs - 15 to 20 pages
  - Strategic topic 1: Gusto 3 Year Strategic Plan - 5 to 10 pages  
    ‚óã Options they considered  
    ‚óã Decision framework  
    ‚óã Product roadmap they plan to pursue  
    ‚óã Product areas they don‚Äôt plan to pursue  
    ‚óã Known vs. Unknown risks  
    ‚óã Initial assessment of economic value to the business  
    ‚óã Discussion on overall thinking and plan
  - Strategic topic 2: Engineering Org - 5 to 10 pages  
    ‚óã Current Engineering Org  
    ‚óã Hiring Scale  
    ‚óã Future Engineering Org (18 months)  
    ‚óã Talent Assessment  
    ‚óã Talent Plan: Retention, Development and Recruitment Opportunities
  - Closed Session (no slides)
  - Appendix  
    ‚óã Health of the organization (10 slides): Hiring metrics by department, Close rates, and Employee Pulse Survey -
    Results

### Behind the scenes preparation

Companies usually start planning a month in advance for the board meeting. In the case of Brex, the co-founders, CFO,
and Chief of Staff align on the list of topics at least a month in advance and kick off a process to pull the materials
together. The CFO leads the charge, working with executives across the company to align on inputs and topics for
discussion.

Here‚Äôs an example of a prep email sent by the Brex CFO to the team 28 days in advance of the board meeting, because
obviously they are working on other things as well so they need that much time to prepare materials in between.

  - T-28 days:  
    ‚óã Founders/Chief of Staff: Identify the two strategic topics for discussion with the board  
    ‚óã Share with executive team to align on topics for discussion
  - T-18 days  
    ‚óã Founders/CFO/Finance team:Outline topics and write/collect content to be covered  
    ‚óã Share draft deck with end of month close data with executive team
  - T-11 days  
    ‚óã Execs comment/edit and provide feedback to Finance Team  
    ‚óã Finance Team finalizes the deck including formatting  
    ‚óã Final review if deck and backup data sent to founders and CFO
  - T-7 days  
    ‚óã Review and final run of edits  
    ‚óã Distribute deck to Board of Directors (BoD)
  - T-4 days  
    ‚óã BoD submits questions (particularly on KPIs)
  - T-2 days  
    ‚óã Brex consolidates and answers all questions from BoD
  - T-0  
    ‚óã Set expectations upfront (which sections you want to spend the most time and where do you need more feedback)

### Involving the executive team in board meetings

Post-Series B, most companies will have an executive leadership team that helps the CEO scale and grow the company.
Note, the general counsel and/or outside counsel can also be invited as part of this. It is important for at least one
of the GC and/or outside counsel to attend all your board meetings to capture notes and discuss any sensitive issues
that require attorney-client privilege.

Since the board is tasked with scaling and governance, it is important for execs to get to know the board (and vice
versa). There are two approaches here: (1) Ask your leadership team to attend the entire board meeting; or (2) Ask only
those executives who have a section to present to the board join the meeting for a particular agenda item, for about 45
minutes.

The problem with the first approach of inviting all executives to the meeting is the board meeting can turn into a
presentation vs. a discussion. It also becomes challenging for the founders and the CEO to discuss sensitive matters
directly.

That‚Äôs why I prefer the latter approach, where specific execs join just for that agenda item (usually about 45 minutes).
This approach achieves three things: a meatier discussion on the strategic issue at hand; the executives hear the
board‚Äôs feedback directly; and more time at the end of the meeting for the CEO and the board to discuss other
sensitive matters on their own.

Remember: The board meeting is not about selling to your board members. Of course, you want to show off great work and
celebrate milestones. But, your board is already bought in, and the highest leverage on their time - and yours\! - is in
helping you get to the next milestone.

### Monthly updates

In addition to quarterly in-person board meetings, it‚Äôs a good practice to send a 2-page monthly update email (sample
[here](founder_link?slug=3w-how-to-create-and-manage-a-board)) to the board at the beginning of every month. The email
usually includes a summary of last month‚Äôs performance; a hiring update; a section outlining burning issues; and a
section with specific asks for help.

Brex always makes two specific asks in their monthly emails: potential introductions to business partners/customers, and
help with key roles they are looking to fill. In their monthly investor update, GitLab will ask for introductions to
specific individuals at companies who can be potential customers -- they also applaud specific investors who have helped
them in the past, putting pressure on the entire board to do the same.

Getting into a good rhythm of sending monthly updates accomplishes three things: (1) Board members will go above and
beyond to help you with your specific asks; (2) The board is better prepared for the in-person board meetings; and (3)
It is a great way for you as the CEO to take a step back and reflect on the most important elements of your business and
objectively measure how well you are doing as a company. Often writing vs. talking is more effective for showcasing your
clarity of thought, and written narrative is more compelling in sharing ideas than bullet points and slides, as Jeff
Bezos has argued [about
memos](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/jeff-bezos-bans-powerpoint-in-meetings-his-replacement-is-brilliant.html).

### Bonus: Letter to the board

In fact, some CEOs may even use the board meeting as an opportunity to take a step back and write a letter to the board.
For example, Peter Reinhardt, CEO of Segment, writes a 3-5 page memo that focuses on highlights, lowlights, and areas
where he would like to spend more time vs. where he‚Äôs spending time today. He prefers the written format vs. slides in
the deck as it allows him to reflect on the quarter and articulate the company's future. More importantly, he focuses on
his own strengths and weaknesses and what he could be doing better as a CEO.

Faire often uses the written memo format to discuss the strategic priorities during the board meeting. The memo sets the
context for the discussion, articulates their decision framework, and explains why they are recommending a particular
approach. They also write down all the uncertainties and blind spots they have when it comes to making that decision.
Not only do these memos help the board prepare for the discussion, but they help the CEO create a record of the quality
of their decision-making processes.

## Leveraging Your Board & Navigating Issues

Most issues boil down to communication, which is why following the best practices outlined so far can help smooth the
way. However, there are a lot of incremental opportunities CEOs may leave on the table when it comes to
managing/leveraging their boards -- as well as obstacles that come up from frictions or specific issues. I‚Äôll share our
collective advice on navigating these below.

### Mixed messages

Conflicting viewpoints are a good thing\! The job of the board is to push you on your strategy and to ask questions that
help you sharpen your thinking. As a CEO you should welcome conflicting opinions and should not feel pressure to get the
board to come to a consensus decision.

However, if the conflict reaches a point where it is hard to move the conversation forward, offer to take the
conversation offline and set up 1:1‚Äôs or small group meetings to understand the conflicting views. After understanding
conflicting viewpoints, use a decision-making framework (as an example see one below) to guide the discussion.

A YC CEO recently shared how two board members had strong, directly conflicting opinions about the order in which they
should pursue new products. The CEO took the discussion offline and came up with a decision-making framework (e.g.
economic value, resources, cash needs, and competitive threat) to decide which path they were going to take. Coming up
with the framework also made it quite clear which path was the right one for the company, and why. Sometimes the answer
is not very clear but a framework is helpful when you decide to go against the board‚Äôs advice. Your board members will
never be as close to the business to make that decision. While board members provide important input all CEOs should
seriously consider, the CEO has the authority to make the best decision on behalf of the company. As long as you have a
clear decision-making framework, your board members will understand when you disagree. Also with time if you are more
right than wrong about your decisions, the board will be willing to disagree and commit to the path forward.

### Asking board members for help

As you get a better sense of the areas where different board members can be most helpful - whether it‚Äôs helping recruit
execs, offering fundraising advice, or other areas - don‚Äôt hesitate to follow up directly with them outside of board
meetings on those topics.

Many CEOs seem to think it‚Äôs important to update every board member 1:1 on every topic. To which I say: NO\! Not every
board member needs to be in the loop on every topic or issue; it‚Äôs an ineffective use of everyone‚Äôs time, including
yours. I also think it is a poor use of time to update every board member 1:1 before every board meeting. Unless there
are sensitive topics that need to be discussed before hand, don‚Äôt waste time doing 1:1 calls with board members to get
everyone on the same page. Allow your board members to challenge you and the team during the board meetings and
encourage conflicting views to help flesh out your thinking.

### Balancing helpfulness vs control

Be cautious of board members who are trying to make decisions for you. A board member‚Äôs job is to help you think through
the issues by offering tools or decision frameworks‚Äì‚Äìnot to give you all the answers on how to run your business.

In fact, great board members will often refrain from stating opinions; instead, they ask questions to help flesh out a
CEO‚Äôs thinking. My fellow board member at Brex, Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital, does this: Even if the CEO asks for his
opinion on, say, ‚ÄúWhat should our typical credit loss rate be?‚Äù, Micky would respond with examples of 10 startups in
Ribbit‚Äôs portfolio and their trajectory along credit loss rates; share pros and cons of each approach; yet refrain from
giving one definitive answer. In doing so, he empowers the founders to make the decision.

### Problem (overbearing / unhelpful) board members

As mentioned earlier, backchannel checks are a great way to test for quality and helpfulness, so take the time to do
this. But, if you still end up getting stuck with an unhelpful board member, the best way to handle this is to first
meet 1:1 and share that feedback, constructively (not unlike running a feedback meeting with your peers or direct
reports).

Be sure to focus on the issue at hand - don‚Äôt make it personal and/or scattered - and share specific examples from past
board meetings where their feedback was not helpful. If you have a good relationship with other members of the board,
you can also work with them to understand how to raise the issue with the unhelpful board member.

In some cases, board members may step in and give feedback to fellow board members. But be careful about a board member
who tries to work around the CEO. One YC company recently faced this - the board member started having direct meetings
with senior management without the CEOs knowledge and jumped to conclusions without full context. This put the CEO in a
really tough spot. The CEO used this as an opportunity to have 1:1 conversations with other board members, gather
feedback, and directly approach the board member who was being disruptive. It took about 6 months to get the situation
resolved and trust was re-established. The CEO worked with the rest of the board to set up a decision framework on when
and how the board can intervene. Use every challenging situation as an opportunity to improve your existing processes.

### Removing board members

This one is really hard\! The situation arises when a board member is destructive to the company - trying to meddle,
micromanage, act like an operator running the company - and sometimes even leaking information to the press. If you have
tried everything (such as talking to the board member directly) and are convinced that your board member is destructive
to the company, then you have a couple of options. I suggest the following, either (1) Approach someone senior at the
firm (where the board member works) and seek a replacement or (2) Add more board members (independent or via new
investment rounds) who can be a sounding board and help address some of the issues.

If you pursue option (1), you will burn bridges with the board member and potentially the firm. If your company is not
in good standing (*i.e.*, metrics don‚Äôt look good, and potential doesn‚Äôt look great) then it will be hard to find a
replacement. You will likely be stuck with your current board member. However, if your company is doing well then you
have more negotiating leverage than you think. If your company is one of the best performing companies in the VC‚Äôs
portfolio, the firm will work hard to find you the board member that you want.

If you pursue option (2), you can leverage other board members to push back when the unhelpful board member is giving
advice that is not productive and could hurt the company. At the end of the day, you don‚Äôt have to listen to the board‚Äôs
advice if you are convinced that it does more harm than good.

That said, as a founder and CEO you should work to understand the gravity of the situation. Board members have the right
intent‚Äì‚Äìtheir job and their incentives are aligned to set the company up for success. If all your board members are
echoing the same feedback and you are not listening, then the problem is likely you. Some CEOs bring their executive
coach to one or two board meetings to get feedback on board dynamics. This may also help calibrate your perception of
the board members around the table. I have also seen a few CEOs seek bi-annual feedback from the entire board via the
executive coach.

## Final Thoughts

Many CEOs get nervous at the idea of board meetings. But they‚Äôre a good thing. They remind you that you are not alone.
Your board of directors - when composed and managed well - is dedicated to your company‚Äôs success, which means they will
challenge you to make better decisions but are on your side as long as you are being ethical and doing the right thing
for the company. And of course, what is considered an effective board will evolve over time as the company matures. But,
you can be intentional in building the right team of advisors up front, using the best practices outlined above. If
knowing is half the battle, why not enlist the best help you can get?

Their story of grit, determination, and creativity, is an epic one.</p>

<p>Spenser and Curtis first applied to YC in 2011, but their idea, a new version of Mechanical Turk, did not impress YC‚Äôs reviewers at the time, and although they were clearly brilliant hackers, that first application was rejected.</p>

<p>It is always a good sign when founders come back and, indeed, they came up with a new idea and applied for the Winter 2012 batch. Their company ‚ÄúSonalight‚Äù, was accepted to YC W12, despite what Spenser remembers as PG‚Äôs skepticism that the technology and market were ready for the product they intended to build.</p>

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2011-03-22-Spenser-Curtis-at-SFO.jpg" alt="Amplitude founders" width="340" height="299" class="size-full wp-image-1104944" /><br/>
<b>Amplitude founders Spenser Skates and Curtis Liu - March 2011</b>

<p>Their new idea was intended to make it safe to text while driving by converting text to speech. This wasn‚Äôt nearly so common or easy back then, and despite PG‚Äôs skepticism, it was clear to us that this was a team focused on building products that customers actually wanted and needed. They successfully built the software, but had a hard time finding paying customers. It turns out that although this is a good idea (many of us use something of the sort today), PG‚Äôs insight had been right-on and at the time, it wasn‚Äôt a great business. Spenser and Curtis figured this out rapidly and by the spring of 2012 they were searching once again for the right product to build.</p>

<p>I remember having office hours with Spenser and Curtis at the time, and they were considering a product in the education space, which naturally I loved and encouraged. But, in fact, they rather quickly settled on a different problem space that they understood deeply and which immediately resonated with their batchmates. It was also a problem for which the market had not yet, in Spenser and Curtis‚Äôs opinion, come up with a great solution. Their chosen target was, of course, mobile analytics. This, it turned out, was precisely the right idea for the team. Around this time, Jeffrey Wang, a Stanford computer scientist and top-quality hacker, joined Spenser and Curtis as co-founder.</p>

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2014-09-Stanford-Fall-Career-Fair-Spenser-Jeffrey.jpg" alt="Amplitude Founders" width="960" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-1104946" /><br/>
<b>Amplitude founders Spenser Skates and and Jeffrey Wang - September 2014</b>

<p>When an excellent team turns to a new problem, you see results unbelievably quickly. In just a few months, they were ready to launch.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amplitude-Dashboard.jpeg" alt="Amplitude Dashboard" width="2048" height="1224" class="size-full wp-image-1104949" />
<br/> <b>The monitor on the wall had Amplitude's analytics dashboard on it, and it was on 24/7.</b>

One thing no one could ever doubt about the Amplitude founders was their ability to build: they are really strong
hackers. And once they had a product, they almost immediately had customers. This was a really good sign. Within a
couple of months, everyone‚Äôs confidence was soaring. We all, including PG, believed in the team and the idea, and it was
pretty obvious they were onto something real.</p>

<p>A year later, Amplitude had real revenue, was tracking billions of events per month, and the epic company they have become was taking shape.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2015-02-08-22.25.48.jpg" alt="Amplitude team - 2015" width="1280" height="960" class="size-full wp-image-1104947" /><br/> <b>Amplitude team - February 2015</b>

<p>Over the subsequent years, the team was met with lots of skepticism about the size of their opportunity, but at every stage, they simply put their heads down, built fantastic software and products, and grew. They stayed close to YC, even sharing an office with our own Michael Seibel, who was running SocialCam at the time. In the end, Amplitude managed to dominate their market and today‚Äôs public offering is a huge testament to the fearlessness and smarts which stood out nearly ten years ago. Our heartfelt congratulations to Spenser, Curtis, Jeffrey and everyone at Amplitude.</p>

imagineer a solution to any problem they‚Äôre trying to solve. In reality, executing a startup is a balance between
creativity/intuition/instinct and the scientific method: hypothesize \> a/b test \> conclude \> repeat.

Inspiration will help you find a problem to solve. Creativity will allow you to brainstorm potential solutions to that
problem. The scientific method will guide you toward which of these solutions will actually solve your customer‚Äôs
problem.

Running a scientific method requires having measurement in place. It requires that you have pre-existing analytics
measuring what your users are doing every day. And it requires that when you build new features, you immediately add
them to your analytics system‚Äìminute one. In order for this to work you cannot have the attitude: ‚ÄúThis is obvious, why
would we measure it?‚Äù

Many companies make the mistake of only using internal analytics. They think that if they need an answer they can just
write a DB query to get it. Unfortunately, the harder it is for you to ask a question, the fewer questions you will ask.
By using a standard analytics product (we‚Äôve funded a bunch of them at YC) you enable everyone in your company (even
non-programmers) to ask an unlimited number of questions and get the answers quickly. This is hugely important. I
actually think it would be a good idea for companies to measure employee usage of their analytics product. Measurement
and talking to users improve your ability to be inspired, creative, and break the rules.

Here‚Äôs an example: Tim Robinson, one of our employees at Justin.tv, was building a payments funnel for a new product we
were releasing. When trying to figure out what to put on the header and footer of the payment flow the obvious idea was
to use the standard header and footer from our website. But instead of thinking, ‚Äúthis is obvious, why would we measure
it‚Äù, he measured everything users did when going through the flow. By measuring he realized instead of moving through
the flow with the ‚Äúobvious‚Äù next buttons, users were clicking on the logo at the top of the page, the links on the
footers, everywhere\! So he started removing these items. A designer might say he was screwing up the aesthetics of the
site but as an engineer he could see through the analytics that every time he removed links, payment conversion would
increase. By applying the scientific method of hypothesize \> a/b test \> conclude \> repeat he was able to build a
product that produced a third of our revenue at JTV. What made his work even more amazing is that Justin.tv at that time
wasn‚Äôt really data driven at all. Perhaps it was his background as a scientist led him to this method or perhaps it was
common sense, but without this feature Justin.tv would have died. Thanks Tim\!

The best companies (and employees) are willing to use data to back up their decision making. They don‚Äôt believe that
standards or aesthetics are rules written in stone. They don‚Äôt believe that only product people or founders know the
solutions to problems. They believe that their users can help them understand what to build and how to build it if they

your startup countless times. To be effective, your pitch has to be clear and concise.

In this post I‚Äôve condensed the pitch creation process to answering seven questions. If you can answer all seven
questions succinctly you‚Äôll be well ahead of the curve.

## The Seven Questions

**1. What do you do?**  
Start with the name of your company and what it does. For example ‚ÄúSocialcam is a mobile app that makes it easy to take
videos and share them with friends and family.‚Äù There‚Äôs no need to set up the problem, you can just get to the point.

Too many people spend too much energy trying to make their idea sound impressive. It‚Äôs ok to keep it simple. Actually,
it‚Äôs preferable. You want to explain what you do in the simplest language possible. This needs to be predigested. Your
elevator pitch should be like baby food.

If you‚Äôre having trouble communicating your product simply, walking me through the user path can be an effective tactic.
For example, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Google. We build a website with a box in it. You can type any question into that box and we‚Äôll show
you websites that answer that question.‚Äù

Walking me through the user path helps avoid explanations like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Google. We organize the world‚Äôs information by
indexing the web.‚Äù With that description I‚Äôm lost.

Your goal when answering this question should not be to have me understand your whole business but rather make me
interested enough to ask follow-up questions.

**2. How big is the market?**  
There are two ways to get market size. If you‚Äôre entering a pre-existing space (like small business banking) you can
research it. If you‚Äôre creating a new product or space (like Slack), you can estimate the number of customers that would
want your product and approximate how much you could charge them.

For example: Bellabeat makes an activity tracker for women. There are X women between 14 and 45 in the US. The lifecycle
of our activity tracker is two years. Our market opportunity in the US is Y.

When you‚Äôre estimating market size and what % you could own, there are two methods: top down and bottom up. With the top
down approach you determine the total market and estimate your potential share of it. With bottom up you figure out
where comparable products are sold, how many of them are sold, and what % of those sales you could take. I prefer the
bottom up method because it helps you avoid a common top down pitfall, which is not narrowing down the customer enough.
In the example above that could mean assuming all women are in your market - no matter their age or nationality.

**3. What‚Äôs your progress?**  
What I‚Äôm trying to understand here is how fast you produce work. What is the ratio between what you‚Äôve done and how long
you‚Äôve been working on it?

I want to feel impressed with how much you‚Äôve done in the period of time you‚Äôve had to do it. This can apply to a
company that‚Äôs one week old or ten years old.

I also tend to value product development and customers first and other things such as fundraising or biz dev deals a
distant second.

**4. What‚Äôs your unique insight?**  
This is similar to ‚ÄúWhat problem are you solving?‚Äù but the bar is higher. What I really want to understand is what you
know about the problem that everyone else doesn‚Äôt. This is usually derived from multiple conversations with customers,
deep analysis of current products in the space, and often personal experience.

For example: Gmail. A unique insight was that the email inbox is a personal database of communication and documents. Why
would a user ever want to delete anything in their personal database? Gmail gave people enough storage so they would
never have to delete a conversation. It‚Äôs not that people needed email. It already existed. And it‚Äôs not that people
needed better email. That‚Äôs too vague. A unique insight is specific and doesn‚Äôt contain complicated language.

Between your market and your unique insight, you have two opportunities to teach me something. A startup‚Äôs unique
insight often gives me more of an aha moment than the explanation of what the company does.

It‚Äôs worth noting that passion doesn‚Äôt help here. Saying a bad unique insight forcefully makes you look worse, not
better. For example, ‚ÄúDude, email today is fucking broken.‚Äù

**5. What‚Äôs your business model?**  
There are two types of startups, those that know how they‚Äôll make money and those that haven‚Äôt figured it out yet. By
and large, if you‚Äôre in the second category you‚Äôre going to either make money by growing big and turning on advertising
or you‚Äôre going to copy the predominant business model in your space. A small subset of companies in the second category
will propose a new business model that makes sense given how you product changes the market‚Äìfreemium is a good example
of this.

One mistake I often used to make at Justin.tv was offering a potpourri of business models (virtual goods, product
placement, chat ads, contests, etc..). I was embarrassed to say Justin.tv would monetize with advertising when clearly
that was the only answer. Own the simple business model.

**6. Who‚Äôs on your team?**  
I‚Äôm only interested in a few things: How many founders? Is there a technical co-founder? How long have they known each
other? Is everyone working full time? What is the equity split among the founders (hopefully equal or close to equal)?

If there‚Äôs an extremely relevant credential I also want to hear that. For example: You‚Äôre building a rocket company and
you used to be the rocket scientist for SpaceX. Basically, if you‚Äôre focusing on a deeply complex or regulated space,
having the expertise in house to plausibly tackle those problems is important.

You don‚Äôt need to mention your GPA or that you once worked at Google.

**7. What do you want?**  
There‚Äôs no need to dance around the ask. If you want me to invest, ask. If you have a question, ask. Though to be clear,
‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù is a bad question. ‚ÄúDo I have a good idea?‚Äù is another bad question.

Make it easy for me to help you. I want to help you.

**Improving Your Answers**  
Once you have answers to each of the seven questions your challenge is to make the answers as clear as possible. To do
that you need to eliminate jargon, acronyms, marketing speak, and any ambiguous terms such as ‚Äúplatform‚Äù. Basically,
make it sound dumber than you think it should.

One tactic you can try is what I call ‚ÄúThe Email Test‚Äù. Write up a two sentence explanation of what your startup does
then email it to a smart friend. Ask them to explain it back to you in different words. If they ask any clarifying
questions, you need to revise your pitch. It‚Äôs important to do this over email because you can‚Äôt add explanations as you
would in conversation.

One thing we do during the YC batch that most people don‚Äôt realize is we help companies with their two sentence pitch.
The answer to the question ‚Äúwhat do you do‚Äù? We work on it every group office hours for the entire batch. It‚Äôs the
linchpin of a good demo day presentation. If that‚Äôs locked, writing a good demo day presentation is easy.

The real thing to remember when editing your answers is that you don‚Äôt need to sound cool. You need to be clear. Don‚Äôt
try to have pizzazz. You don‚Äôt want pizzazz.

**Conclusion**  
I‚Äôm much more interested in progress than genius ideas. Most good ideas don‚Äôt look like good ideas the first time you
see them so your ability to show progress in your work and intellect in how you answer these questions are two very
positive signals. Once I understand what you‚Äôre working on it‚Äôs all about making me believe that it‚Äôs plausible that you
can succeed.

As the founder of a startup that graduated from Y Combinator last August I‚Äôm often asked about my experience -
particularly by other founders. Was it valuable? What did we get out of it? What did we learn? There‚Äôs a perception in
some corners of the Valley that Y Combinator is like an elite Ivy League institution whose main benefit has less to do
with education, and more to do with networking. Y Combinator, it is said, is all about introducing you to the ‚Äúright‚Äù
people and photoshopping off your blemishes like a cover model so that you look attractive to potential investors on
demo day.

Having gone through the process, I can tell you that that‚Äôs not what YC is about. Y Combinator is about understanding
the metrics you need to hit to grow and thrive, how to be laser-focused on your company‚Äôs goals and lots and lots of
hard work. I tried to explain this to those who asked, but ‚ÄúYC takes work‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite cover it.

So, in an attempt to quantify what we experienced, I charted the hours worked by myself and my fellow batchmates in YC
S16 during both the lead-up to our time in Y Combinator and the three months that we spent in the batch (June -
August 2016). In order to calculate the hours I used People.ai‚Äôs AI engine.

The People.ai engine automatically collects data on emails sent and received and time spent in meetings and phone calls
to present an accurate picture of how teams are spending their time in a single dashboard, as seen below. Different
colors correspond to various categories of activities as seen here:

Here are the results I got when I ran the numbers for myself and some of my fellow batchmmates:

A few points stand out to me:

  - In early June, at the very beginning of their time in the batch, founders‚Äô hours seem to decline because they are
    spending time ‚Äúoutside the system.‚Äù June, particularly early June, was a time where our batch focused on tweaking
    their original ideas and ensuring good product/market fit for the vision that our companies would eventually become.
    But, starting in early July, the change was tangible.
  - Nearly universally beginning in early July, and continuing through August, the hours that founders logged increased
    dramatically. Take me for example, I logged about 50 hours in the first week of June, a number that doubled to 100
    hours two months later during the first week of August. While my hours would decline towards the end of the month
    they remained much higher than my previous peaks in May and June.
  - In fact, with the exception of Michael, the hours logged by the rest of us founders ranged from 150% to a truly
    earth-shattering 400% of our previous peaks before taking part in YC.
  - Each founder was unique in how they spent their time. Some focused on meetings while others spent longer on email.
  - Almost no time in the batch was spent on the phone - there was an overwhelming focus on attending meetings (whether
    internal or external) in person, or at least dealing with issues over email.

There‚Äôs a reason that acceptance into YC includes a demand that founding teams move to Silicon Valley for the duration
of the batch. Participating in Y Combinator requires you to put all other distractions aside and focus on just two
things: developing your product and delivering growth. As a YC founder you gain a certain drive to get results and hit
the challenging targets set by your mentors and batchmates.

The reason that Y Combinator alumni like Airbnb and Docker are so successful isn‚Äôt because YC teaches you Jedi mind
tricks or because it gives you access to an elite network. It‚Äôs simply a result of the age-old equation: smart people +
focus = good things. YC can‚Äôt make you smart, but it can, and does, teach you to focus solely on the metrics that are
going to make you successful as an organization.

So there you have it. At the risk of sounding cliche, there is simply no alternative to hard work, sweat and tears.
While we received myriad benefits from attending Y Combinator, by far the most important was the batch‚Äôs effect on our
team. At Y Combinator you learn how to get shit done.

As our group partner, Michael Seibel, would say - *boom\!* that‚Äôs it, the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù of Y Combinator‚Äôs success and what
you get from participating in the batch.

pieces of advice.

Mail us your resume ([workatastartup@ycombinator.com](https://mailto:workatastartup@ycombinator.com)) if you want
feedback or pointers. And if you‚Äôre looking for a job, check out our active jobs list on [Work at a
Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com), which makes it simple to browse the 400+ YC companies that are well-funded and
actively hiring, including larger ones like [Gusto](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/gusto),
[Brex](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/brex) and [Stripe](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/stripe).

**Resume: For each position on your resume, be sure to cover what, how and impact.**

  - ***What did you work on?*** Assume that recruiters and hiring managers don‚Äôt know much about your last company or
    role. So provide a brief description about the product line or initiative, so they can find you the right role or
    team.
  - ***How did you get your work done?*** With each position, be sure to include technologies you used ‚Äî programming
    languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. Do not dump them all into one big ‚ÄúTechnology‚Äù section at the bottom of your
    resume. Technology is very contextual and time-specific: my SOAP/XML-RPC work at Salesforce made sense 20 years ago,
    but it makes no sense for a modern web stack today. Also, provide team size and departments you worked with. It‚Äôs
    useful for a hiring manager to know if you‚Äôve successfully worked cross-functionally ‚Äî with product, designers, ops,
    and more.
  - ***What impact did you have?*** Share your impact on the business ‚Äî growth numbers, cost savings, sales increase,
    marketing distribution. This shows you‚Äôve been given responsibility ‚Äî and delivered ‚Äî to benefit the business.

Lastly, do some spring cleaning. Remove side projects that don‚Äôt necessarily match the job, especially if there are more
recent examples on your resume. For example, if you‚Äôre a lead of a team in your current role, having leadership roles
from 10+ years ago in college isn‚Äôt as relevant. And trim down each position to 3-4 bullet points, maximum. It makes it
easier for the recruiter/hiring manager to read it all, and shows you can be concise and direct.

**Cold outreach: Highlight 2-3 things you‚Äôd be excited to work on at the company ‚Äî and why.**

When applying to a position, be sure to suggest ways you‚Äôd be excited to contribute; include these suggestions on your
resume, cover letter or in an intro email. Being a genuine user is a huge plus. These things can helps you stand out
from the hundreds of other resumes in the recruiter‚Äôs inbox.

At Twitter, I hired a few people who stood out because they showed initiative: suggesting strong product
ideas/improvements, outlining plans for go-to-market, or even writing sample code showcasing skills and interest. And I
practice this myself; when I interviewed at Lyft, I reversed engineered the API and built a small SDK to perform common
tasks. It took a couple nights learning WireShark, but it ultimately helped me land the job.

**Considering startups: Ask about runway & burn rate.**

Many YC startups are well funded (some even with $10M+ raised) and offer benefits and job security equal to more
established companies. If you‚Äôre considering startups, know what to ask about, like runway and burn rate.

  - ***Runway*** is the number of months the startup has to operate, based on money raised and revenue. There is no
    ‚Äúright‚Äù answer, but you likely want to work somewhere with enough runway to weather this pandemic, and still get
    the business in good shape after that (if it‚Äôs not already).
  - ***Burn rate*** is the company‚Äôs monthly spend. During my time at Zuora, we made it a goal to be ‚Äúin the black‚Äù (not
    burning more than we were earning), and it helped us survive the 2009 market crash. Not all startups have the luxury
    of early revenue, but knowing the financial levers to the company will help you understand the business (and how the
    founders think about it).

You should be discussing these things with the founders at least at the offer stage, if not earlier. We tell YC founders
to be transparent with this information, not just because it‚Äôs the right thing to do, but also because it helps
establish mutual trust. You should be wary of founders ‚Äî YC or otherwise ‚Äî who are not forthcoming and honest, as a
reflection of what to expect later down the road.

-----

The silver lining of the current job market is that 1.) there are still a lot of great companies that are actively
hiring (including hundreds of YC companies), and 2.) job offers have not yet decreased ‚Äî mostly because many of the
larger companies are still competing for good talent.

Hopefully the above helps you stand out and get conversations going. At YC, we‚Äôll continue to share more on job hunting,
including interviewing and negotiating offers. Reach out if YC or I can help. You got this.

had meandering product meetings where we didn‚Äôt write down our decisions. We didn‚Äôt carefully spec new products so team
members often had slightly different ideas about what we were building. We always wanted to build fully formed products
instead of MVPs. And we rarely spec‚Äôd the analytics for new products so we often didn‚Äôt know how they were performing
post-launch.

Development cycles often ran months. We were sick of the new feature by the time we launched them so we didn‚Äôt iterate.
Our product roadmap was so long that team members weren‚Äôt excited to brainstorm new products because it was unclear if
they would ever be built. And most horribly, product decisions were made exclusively by the founders in a
non-transparent process. Things were a mess.

In this post I‚Äôm going to cover product development cycle fundamentals that I learned to help solve all of the problems
above. This will help you rapidly iterate, measure, test, and improve your product while fully engaging your team. This
is not that same as shipping an MVP. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve released an MVP and are figuring out what to do next, which is
where most startups spend most of their time.

**Define Your Development Cycle Length** Your development cycle should be dictated by your product. At Socialcam we were
building for iOS so we settled on a two week cycle, which allowed us to thoroughly test before releasing to the App
Store. If you‚Äôre doing a web app your cycle can be shorter, if it‚Äôs hardware it might be longer. The key is to structure
the cycle so that teammates stay excited and still feel like they can brainstorm new ideas.

**Determine Your Goal(s) and Identify the Product Lead** We ran one and only one team meeting. It was the product
meeting and it happened on the first day of the dev cycle. Sometimes this meeting would go for five hours (sorry).

Every product meeting was focused around one of three goals:

1.  Increasing content creation
2.  Increasing new users
3.  Increasing retention

Whichever goal we chose would be the focus of the meeting and, therefore, the next two weeks.

As the product person on the team my role was to protect and improve the dev cycle and moderate the product meetings to
ensure all team members felt comfortable contributing. Oftentimes just getting the opportunity to voice your idea and
having it written on the board - even if it isn‚Äôt built - massively increases buy-in of the process.

**Organized and Inclusive Brainstorm** While we were brainstorming, ideas would be written on the whiteboard in one of
the following categories: new features/feature iterations, maintenance, and A/B tests. Everyone was expected to
contribute. Debates or putting down other people‚Äôs ideas wasn‚Äôt permitted. This was the time when everyone felt free to
contribute without fear of judgement. The product lead is responsible for creating and maintaining that environment.

From there each brainstormed item would be graded by the engineer in the meeting as easy (several can be done in a day),
medium (half a day for one person), and hard (most of the dev cycle). No item could be so hard that it would last into
another cycle and if it was, we‚Äôd break it into smaller chunks. Usually this grading would be done item by item by the
engineer with the most experience in that specific area. iOS features were ranked by the iOS guy and so on and so forth.
This really helped non-technical people understand which of their ideas were easy to build and which were hard. With
this realization they often got better at thinking up easier and easier MVPs of their ideas. These easy ideas would then
get built and, if they worked, would be iterated upon.

**Building a Consensus** Once we‚Äôd written our ideas out we began to pick what we would work in through consensus. We
would start with the hard ideas‚Äìit was easy to form consensus because we knew we could only do one and because we knew
that we would start a new dev cycle in two weeks. Then medium and then easy. Developing that consensus wasn‚Äôt very hard
because everyone had the opportunity to suggest their own ideas and because there was a clear goal and objective
measurement of how long each idea would take to build. This process allowed you to grade the quality of your own idea
and didn‚Äôt allow personalities to bully their pet ideas through.

**Clear Spec and Clear Measurements of Success** Afterwards we would spec out each of the items on our list in detail
and assign each item to a team member (or multiple team members). We would also spec the stats we needed to track in
order to measure how effective the feature was. We would never release a feature without releasing the analytics for
that feature and understanding what specific measurable result we wanted to create. Finally, we separated out the need
to haves from the nice to haves on the list. If there wasn‚Äôt time, the nice to haves would not be built. After that was
done we would take a picture of the whiteboard and delete it. We didn‚Äôt have a product roadmap outside of these two
weeks and every product meeting we would start from scratch with the new goal, new analytics data from our last two
weeks, and also often new insights from in-person user testing, which we tried to do once a month.

**Working During the Development Cycle** For me, work after the first monday of the development cycle was a silent
affair. My job was to get all the business and operations tasks done. Then I‚Äôd dig through Mixpanel looking for
interesting product insights or potential bugs. Finally, I also ran monthly user testing sessions in our office. My
teammates - engineers and a designer - would work quietly and quickly knowing they had projects with limited scopes that
were well spec‚Äôd out. Finally, during the last three days of every development cycle we would all stop building and
test. We had a testing list in Excel that included manual tests for all of our basic functionality. Every cycle we added
tests for new features built in that cycle and we tested all items on our testing list twice. Everyone on the team
tested and we often had competitions for who could test the fastest and who found the most bugs. Testing sucks so it‚Äôs
important that the burden is shared.

**The Results** At the end of the day, Socialcam did not achieve our dream of being the ‚ÄúInstagram for Video‚Äù. In fact
what we should have built looks a lot closer to Snapchat. But this process did allow us to iterate extremely quickly. As
a result we were able to produce a laundry list of cool features very quickly: video filters, video borders, video
titles, video soundtracks, video feed optimizations, multiple visual redesigns, user profiles, recommended channels,
front back camera switching during a video, and much much more. It also allowed us to experiment with growth features
that produced 16 million downloads in about 3 months and over 100 million people watching video on our website during
the same period of time. Most importantly though, we did all of this work quickly, efficiently, without major arguments,
issues with founder commitment, or really any team problems at all. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if
instead of selling the company we kept building for another year‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs another story.

*Thank you Jared, Geoff, and Craig for helping me with this post, Ammon and Guillaume my co-founders at Socialcam, and

Startup companies need to purchase equipment, rent offices, and hire staff. More importantly, they need to grow. In
almost every case they will require outside capital to do these things.

The initial capital raised by a company is typically called ‚Äúseed‚Äù capital. This brief guide is a summary of what
startup founders need to know about raising the seed funds critical to getting their company off the ground.

This is not intended to be a complete guide to fundraising. It includes only the basic knowledge most founders will
need. The information comes from my experiences working at startups, investing in startups, and advising startups at Y
Combinator and Imagine K12. YC partners naturally gain a lot of fundraising experience and YC founder Paul Graham (PG)
has written extensively on the topic [1](#e1), [2](#e2), [3](#e3), [4](#e4). His essays cover in more detail much of
what is contained in this guide and are highly recommended reading.

### Why Raise Money?

Without startup funding the vast majority of startups will die. The amount of money needed to take a startup to
profitability is usually well beyond the ability of founders and their friends and family to finance. A startup here
means a company that is built to grow fast [12](#e12). High growth companies almost always need to burn capital to
sustain their growth prior to achieving profitability. A few startup companies do successfully bootstrap (self-fund)
themselves, but they are the exception. Of course, there are lots of great companies that aren‚Äôt startups. Managing
capital needs for such companies is not covered herein.

Cash not only allows startups to live and grow, a war chest is also almost always a competitive advantage in all ways
that matter: hiring key staff, public relations, marketing, and sales. Thus, most startups will almost certainly want to
raise money. The good news is that there are lots of investors hoping to give the right startup money. The bad news is,
‚ÄúFundraising is brutal‚Äù [1](#e1). The process of raising that money is often long, arduous, complex, and ego
deflating. Nevertheless, it is a path almost all companies and founders must walk, but when is the time right to raise?

### When to Raise Money

Investors write checks when the idea they hear is compelling, when they are persuaded that the team of founders can
realize its vision, and that the opportunity described is real and sufficiently large. When founders are ready to tell
this story, they can raise money. And usually when you can raise money, you should.

For some founders it is enough to have a story and a reputation. However, for most it will require an idea, a product,
and some amount of customer adoption, a.k.a. traction. Luckily, the software development ecosystem today is such that a
sophisticated web or mobile product can be built and delivered in a remarkably short period of time at very low cost.
Even hardware can be rapidly prototyped and tested.

But investors also need persuading. Usually a product they can see, use, or touch will not be enough. They will want to
know that there is product market fit and that the product is experiencing actual growth.

Therefore, founders should raise money when they have figured out what the market opportunity is and who the customer
is, and when they have delivered a product that matches their needs and is being adopted at an interestingly rapid rate.
How rapid is interesting? This depends, but a rate of 10% per week for several weeks is impressive. And to raise money
founders need to impress. For founders who can convince investors without these things, congratulations. For everyone
else, work on your product and talk to your users.

### How Much to Raise?

Ideally, you should raise as much money as you need to reach profitability, so that you‚Äôll never have to raise money
again. If you succeed in this, not only will you find it easier to raise money in the future, you‚Äôll be able to survive
without new funding if the funding environment gets tight. That said, certain kinds of startups will need a follow-on
round, such as those building hardware. Their goal should be to raise as much money as needed to get to their next
‚Äúfundable‚Äù milestone, which will usually be 12 to 18 months later.

In choosing how much to raise you are trading off several variables, including how much progress that amount of money
will purchase, credibility with investors, and dilution. If you can manage to give up as little as 10% of your company
in your seed round, that is wonderful, but most rounds will require up to 20% dilution and you should try to avoid more
than 25%. In any event, the amount you are asking for must be tied to a believable plan. That plan will buy you the
credibility necessary to persuade investors that their money will have a chance to grow. It is usually a good idea to
create multiple plans assuming different amounts raised and to carefully articulate your belief that the company will be
successful whether you raise the full or some lesser amount. The difference will be how fast you can grow.

One way to look at the optimal amount to raise in your first round is to decide how many months of operation you want to
fund. A rule of thumb is that an engineer (the most common early employee for Silicon Valley startups) costs all-in
about $15k per month. So, if you would like to be funded for 18 months of operations with an average of five engineers,
then you will need about 15k x 5 x 18 = $1.35mm. What if you are planning to hire for other positions as well? Don‚Äôt
worry about it\! This is just an estimate and will be accurate enough for whatever mix you hire. And here you have a
great answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow much are you raising?‚Äù Simply answer that you are raising for N months
(usually 12-18) and will thus need $X, where X will usually be between $500k and $1.5 million. As noted above, you
should give multiple versions of N and a range for X, giving different possible growth scenarios based on how much you
successfully raise.

There is enormous variation in the amount of money raised by companies. Here we are concerned with early raises, which
usually range from a few hundreds of thousands of dollars up to two million dollars. Most first rounds seem to cluster
around six hundred thousand dollars, but largely thanks to increased interest from investors in seed, these rounds have
been increasing in size over the last several years.

### Financing Options

Startup founders must understand the basic concepts behind venture financing. It would be nice if this was all very
simple and could be explained in a single paragraph. Unfortunately, as with most legal matters, that‚Äôs not possible.
Here is a very high level summary, but it is worth your time to read more about the details and pros and cons of various
types of financing and, importantly, the key terms of such deals that you need to be aware of, from preferences to
option pools. The articles below are a decent start.

  - [Venture Hacks / Babk Nivi: Should I Raise Debt or Equity](http://venturehacks.com/articles/debt-or-equity)

  - [Fred Wilson: Financing Options](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/07/financing-options-convertible-debt.html)

  - [Mark Suster on Convertible
    Debt](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/the-truth-about-convertible-debt-at-startups-and-the-hidden-terms-you-didn-t-understand-9fccf6854dee#.z63i0cy5g)

  - [Announcing the Safe](https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-the-safe-a-replacement-for-convertible-notes)
    
    Venture financing usually takes place in ‚Äúrounds,‚Äù which have traditionally had names and a specific order. First
    comes a seed round, then a Series A, then a Series B, then a Series C, and so on to acquisition or IPO. None of
    these rounds are required and, for example, sometimes companies will start with a Series A financing (almost always
    an ‚Äúequity round‚Äù as defined below). Recall that we are focusing here exclusively on seed, that very first venture
    round.
    
    Most seed rounds, at least in Silicon Valley, are now structured as either convertible debt or simple agreements for
    future equity (safes) [17](#e17). Some early rounds are still done with equity, but in Silicon Valley they are now
    the exception.
    
    ### Convertible Debt
    
    Convertible debt is a loan an investor makes to a company using an instrument called a convertible note. That loan
    will have a principal amount (the amount of the investment), an interest rate (usually a minimum rate of 2% or so),
    and a maturity date (when the principal and interest must be repaid). The intention of this note is that it converts
    to equity (thus, ‚Äúconvertible‚Äù) when the company does an equity financing. These notes will also usually have a
    ‚ÄúCap‚Äù or ‚ÄúTarget Valuation‚Äù and / or a discount. A Cap is the maximum effective valuation that the owner of the
    note will pay, regardless of the valuation of the round in which the note converts. The effect of the cap is that
    convertible note investors usually pay a lower price per share compared to other investors in the equity round.
    Similarly, a discount defines a lower effective valuation via a percentage off the round valuation. Investors see
    these as their seed ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and both of these terms are negotiable. Convertible debt may be called at maturity, at
    which time it must be repaid with earned interest, although investors are often willing to extend the maturity dates
    on notes.
    
    ### Safe
    
    Convertible debt has been almost completely replaced by the safe at YC and Imagine K12. A safe acts like convertible
    debt without the interest rate, maturity, and repayment requirement. The negotiable terms of a safe will almost
    always be simply the amount, the cap, and the discount, if any. There is a bit more complexity to any convertible
    security, and much of that is driven by what happens when conversion occurs. I strongly encourage you to read the
    safe primer [18](#e18), which is available on [YC‚Äôs site](http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). The primer has
    several examples of what happens when a safe converts, which go a long way toward explaining how both convertible
    debt and safes work in practice.
    
    ### Equity
    
    An equity round means setting a valuation for your company (generally, the cap on the safes or notes is considered
    as a company‚Äôs notional valuation, although notes and safes can also be uncapped) and thus a per-share price, and
    then issuing and selling new shares of the company to investors. This is always more complicated, expensive, and
    time consuming than a safe or convertible note and explains their popularity for early rounds. It is also why you
    will always want to hire a lawyer when planning to issue equity.
    
    To understand what happens when new equity is issued, a simple example helps. Say you raise $1,000,000 on a
    $5,000,000 pre-money valuation. If you also have 10,000,000 shares outstanding then you are selling the shares at:

<!-- end list -->

1.  **$5,000,000 / 10,000,000 = 50 cents per share**  
    and you will thus sell...

2.  **2,000,000 shares**  
    resulting in a new share total of...

3.  **10,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 12,000,000 shares**  
    and a post-money valuation of...

4.  **$0.50 \* 12,000,000 = $6,000,000**  
    and dilution of...

5.  **2,000,000 / 12,000,000 = 16.7%**  
    Not 20%\!
    
    There are several important components of an equity round with which you must become familiar when your company does
    a priced round, including equity incentive plans (option pools), liquidation preferences, anti-dilution rights,
    protective provisions, and more. These components are all negotiable, but it is usually the case that if you have
    agreed upon a valuation with your investors (next section), then you are not too far apart, and there is a deal to
    be done. I won‚Äôt say more about equity rounds, since they are so uncommon for seed rounds.
    
    One final note: whatever form of financing you do, it is always best to use well-known financing documents like YC's
    safe. These documents are well understood by the investor community, and have been drafted to be fair, yet founder
    friendly.
    
    ### Valuation: What is my company worth?
    
    You are two hackers with an idea, a few months of hacking‚Äôs worth of software, and several thousand users. What is
    your company worth? It should be obvious that no formula will give you an answer. There can only be the most
    notional sort of justification for any value at all. So, how do you set a value when talking to a potential
    investor? Why do some companies seem to be worth $20mm and some $4mm? Because investors were convinced that was what
    they were (or will be in the near future) worth. It is that simple. Therefore, it is best to let the market set your
    price and to find an investor to set the price or cap. The more investor interest your company generates, the higher
    your value will trend.
    
    Still, it can be difficult in some circumstances to find an investor to tell you what you are worth. In this case
    you can choose a valuation, usually by looking at comparable companies who have valuations. Please remember that the
    important thing in choosing your valuation is not to over-optimize. The objective is to find a valuation with which
    you are comfortable, that will allow you to raise the amount you need to achieve your goals with acceptable
    dilution, and that investors will find reasonable and attractive enough to write you a check. Seed valuations tend
    to range from $2mm-$10mm, but keep in mind that the goal is not to achieve the best valuation, nor does a high
    valuation increase your likelihood of success.
    
    ### Investors: Angels & Venture Capitalists
    
    The difference between an angel and a VC is that angels are amateurs and VCs are pros. VCs invest other people‚Äôs
    money and angels invest their own on their own terms. Although some angels are quite rigorous and act very much like
    the pros, for the most part they are much more like hobbyists. Their decision making process is usually much
    faster--they can make the call all on their own--and there is almost always a much larger component of emotion that
    goes into that decision.
    
    VCs will usually require more time, more meetings, and will have multiple partners involved in the final decision.
    And remember, VCs see LOTS of deals and invest in very few, so you will have to stand out from a crowd.
    
    The ecosystem for seed (early) financing is far more complex now than it was even five years ago. There are many new
    VC firms, sometimes called ‚Äúsuper-angels,‚Äù or ‚Äúmicro-VC‚Äôs‚Äù, which explicitly target brand new, very early stage
    companies. There are also several traditional VCs that will invest in seed rounds. And there are a large number of
    independent angels who will invest anywhere from $25k to $100k or more in individual companies. New fundraising
    options have also arisen. For example, [AngelList Syndicates](https://angel.co/syndicates) lets angels pool their
    resources and follow a single lead angel. [FundersClub](http://www.fundersclub.com/founders) invests selectively
    like a traditional VC, but lets angels become LPs in their VC funds to expand connections available to its founders.
    
    How does one meet and encourage the interest of investors? If you are about to present at a demo day, you are going
    to meet lots of investors. There are few such opportunities to meet a concentrated and motivated group of seed
    investors. Besides a demo day, by far the best way to meet a venture capitalist or an angel is via a warm
    introduction. Angels will also often introduce interesting companies to their own networks. Otherwise, find someone
    in your network to make an introduction to an angel or VC. If you have no other options, do research on VCs and
    angels and send as many as you can a **brief**, but compelling summary of your business and opportunity (see
    [Documents You Need](#part12) below).
    
    ### Crowdfunding
    
    There are a growing number of new vehicles to raise money, such as [AngelList](https://angel.co/), [Kickstarter](),
    and [Wefunder](). These crowdfunding sites can be used to launch a product, run a pre-sales campaign, or find
    venture funding. In exceptional cases, founders have used these sites as their dominant fundraising source, or as
    clear evidence of demand. They usually are used to fill in rounds that are largely complete or, at times, to
    reanimate a round that is having difficulty getting off the ground. The ecosystem around investing is changing
    rapidly, but when and how to use these new sources of funds will usually be determined by your success raising
    through more traditional means.
    
    ### Meeting Investors
    
    If you are meeting investors at an investor day, remember that your goal is not to close--it is to get the next
    meeting. Investors will seldom choose to commit the first day they hear your pitch, regardless of how brilliant it
    is. So book lots of meetings. Keep in mind that the hardest part is to get the first money in the company. In other
    words, meet as many investors as possible but focus on those most likely to close. Always optimize for getting money
    soonest (in other words, be greedy) [2](#e2).
    
    There are a few simple rules to follow when preparing to meet with investors. First, make sure you know your
    audience--do research on what they like to invest in and try to figure out why. Second, simplify your pitch to the
    essential--why this is a great product (demos are almost a requirement nowadays), why you are precisely the right
    team to build it, and why together you should all dream about creating the next gigantic company. Next make sure you
    listen carefully to what the investor has to say. If you can get the investor to talk more than you, your
    probability of a deal skyrockets. In the same vein, do what you can to connect with the investor. This is one of the
    main reasons to do research. An investment in a company is a long term commitment and most investors see lots of
    deals. Unless they like you and feel connected to your outcome, they will most certainly not write a check.
    
    Who you are and how well you tell your story are most important when trying to convince investors to write that
    check. Investors are looking for compelling founders who have a believable dream and as much evidence as possible
    documenting the reality of that dream. Find a style that works for you, and then work as hard as necessary to get
    the pitch perfect. Pitching is difficult and often unnatural for founders, especially technical founders who are
    more comfortable in front of a screen than a crowd. But anyone will improve with practice, and there is no
    substitute for an extraordinary amount of practice. Incidentally, this is true whether you are preparing for a demo
    day or an investor meeting.
    
    During your meeting, try to strike a balance between confidence and humility. Never cross over into arrogance, avoid
    defensiveness, but also don‚Äôt be a pushover. Be open to intelligent counterpoints, but stand up for what you believe
    and whether or not you persuade the investor just then, you‚Äôll have made a good impression and will probably get
    another shot.
    
    Lastly, make sure you don‚Äôt leave an investor meeting without an attempted close or at very minimum absolute clarity
    on next steps. Do not just walk out leaving things ambiguous.
    
    ### Negotiating and Closing the Deal
    
    A seed investment can usually be closed rapidly. As noted above, it is an advantage to use standard documents with
    consistent terms, such as YC‚Äôs safe. Negotiation, and often there is none at all, can then proceed on one or two
    variables, such as the valuation/cap and possibly a discount.
    
    Deals have momentum and there is no recipe towards building momentum behind your deal other than by telling a great
    story, persistence, and legwork. You may have to meet with dozens of investors before you get that close. But to get
    started you just need to convince [5](#e5) one of them. Once the first money is in, each subsequent close will get
    faster and easier [6](#e6).
    
    Once an investor says that they are in, you are almost done. This is where you should rapidly close using a
    handshake protocol [19](#e19). If you fail at negotiating from this point on, it is probably your fault.
    
    ### Negotiations
    
    When you enter into a negotiation with a VC or an angel, remember that they are usually more experienced at it than
    you are, so it is almost always better not to try to negotiate in real-time. Take requests away with you, and get
    help from YC or Imagine K12 partners, advisors, or legal counsel. But also remember that although certain requested
    terms can be egregious, the majority of things credible VCs and angels will ask for tend to be reasonable. Do not
    hesitate to ask them to explain precisely what they are asking for and why. If the negotiation is around valuation
    (or cap) there are, naturally, plenty of considerations, e.g. other deals you have already closed. However, it is
    important to remember that the valuation you choose at this early round will seldom matter to the success or failure
    of the company. Get the best deal you can get--but get the deal\! Finally, once you get to yes, don‚Äôt wait around.
    Get the investor‚Äôs signature and cash as soon as possible. One reason safes are popular is because the closing
    mechanics are as simple as signing a document and then transferring funds. Once an investor has decided to invest,
    it should take no longer than a few minutes to exchange signed documents online (for example via
    [Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) or [Ironclad](https://ironclad.ai/)) and execute a wire or send a check.
    
    ### Documents You Need
    
    Do not spend too much time developing diligence documents for a seed round. If an investor is asking for too much
    due diligence or financials, they are almost certainly someone to avoid. You will probably want an executive summary
    and a slide deck you can walk investors through and, potentially, leave behind so VCs can show to other partners.
    
    The executive summary should be one or two pages (one is better) and should include vision, product, team (location,
    contact info), traction, market size, and minimum financials (revenue, if any, and fundraising prior and current).
    
    Generally make sure the slide deck is a coherent leave-behind. Graphics, charts, screenshots are more powerful than
    lots of words. Consider it a framework around which you will hang a more detailed version of your story. There is no
    fixed format or order, but the following parts are usually present. Create the pitch that matches you, how you
    present, and how you want to represent your company. Also note that like the executive summary, there are lots of
    similar templates online if you don‚Äôt like this one.

1\. **Your company / Logo / Tag Line**

2\. **Your Vision** - Your most expansive take on why your new company exists.

3\. **The Problem** - What are you solving for the customer--where is their pain?

4\. **The Customer** - Who are they and perhaps how will you reach them?

5\. **The Solution** - What you have created and why now is the right time.

6\. **The (huge) Market you are addressing** - Total Available Market (TAM) \>$1B if possible. Include the most
persuasive evidence you have that this is real.

7\. **Market Landscape** - including competition, macro trends, etc. Is there any insight you have that others do not?

8\. **Current Traction** - list key stats / plans for scaling and future customer acquisition.

9\. **Business model** - how users translate to revenue. Actuals, plans, hopes.

10\. **Team** - who you are, where you come from and why you have what it takes to succeed. Pics and bios okay. Specify
roles.

11\. **Summary** - 3-5 key takeaways (market size, key product insight, traction)

12\. **Fundraising** - Include what you have already raised and what you are planning to raise now. Any financial
projections may go here as well. You can optionally include a summary product roadmap (6 quarters max) indicating what
an investment buys.

### Next

It is worth pointing out that startup investing is rapidly evolving and it is likely that certain elements of this guide
will at some point become obsolete, so make sure to check for updates or future posts. There is now an extraordinary
amount of information available on raising venture money. Several sources are referenced and more are listed at the end
of this document.

Fundraising is a necessary, and sometimes painful task most startups must periodically endure. A founder‚Äôs goal should
always be to raise as quickly as possible and this guide will hopefully help founders successfully raise their first
round of venture financing. Often that will seem like a nearly impossible task and when it is complete, it will feel as
though you have climbed a very steep mountain. But you have been distracted by the brutality of fundraising and once you
turn your attention back to the future you will realize it was only a small foothill on the real climb in front of you.
It is time to get back to work building your company.

### Appendix

**Fundraising Rules to Follow**

  - Get fundraising over as soon as possible, and get back to building your product and company, but¬†also‚Ä¶
  - Don‚Äôt stop raising money too soon. If fundraising is difficult, keep fighting and stay¬†alive.
  - When raising, be ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù: breadth-first search weighted by expected value
    [2](http://www.themacro.com/articles/2016/01/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e2). This means talk to as many people as
    you can, prioritizing the ones that are likely to¬†close.
  - Once someone says yes, don‚Äôt delay. Get docs signed and the money in the bank as soon as¬†possible.
  - Always hustle for leads. If you are the hottest deal of the hour, that‚Äôs great, but everyone else needs to work like
    crazy to get angels and other venture investors¬†interested.
  - Never screw anyone over. Hold yourself and others on your team to the highest ethical standards. The Valley is a
    very small place, and a bad reputation is difficult to repair. Play it straight and you will never regret it. You‚Äôll
    feel better for it,¬†too.
  - Investors have a lot of different ways to say no. The hardest thing for an entrepreneur is understanding when they
    are being turned down and being okay with it. PG likes to say, ‚ÄúIf the soda is empty, stop making that awful sucking
    sound with the straw.‚Äù But remember that they might be a ‚Äúyes‚Äù another time, so part on the best possible¬†terms.
  - Develop a style that fits you and your¬†company.
  - Stay organized. Co-founders should split tasks where possible. If necessary, use software like Asana to keep track
    of¬†deals.
  - Have a thick skin but strike the right balance between confidence and humility. And never be¬†arrogant.

**What Not to Do While Communicating with Investors**

**DON'T:**

  - Be dishonest in any¬†way
  - Be arrogant or¬†unfriendly
  - Be overly aggressive
  - Seem indecisive - although it is okay to say you don‚Äôt know¬†yet.
  - Talk so much they cannot get a word in¬†edgewise
  - Be slow to follow-up or close a¬†deal
  - Break an agreement, verbal or¬†written
  - Create detailed financials
  - Use ridiculous / silly market size numbers without clear¬†justification
  - Claim you know something that you don‚Äôt or be afraid to say you don‚Äôt¬†know
  - Spend time on the¬†obvious
  - Get caught up in unimportant minutiae - don‚Äôt let the meeting get away from¬†you
  - Ask for an¬†NDA
  - Try to play investors off each other when you are not a fundraising¬†ninja
  - Try to negotiate in¬†real-time
  - Over-optimize your valuation or worry too much about¬†dilution
  - Take a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù¬†personally

*------------------------------------------------*

This post is advice for early stage startup founders who are hiring their first engineer. At this stage traditional
recruiting methods e.g. hiring a recruiter won't work as well for you as they do for larger companies.

Hiring your first engineer at a startup is incredibly hard. As a founder you're already stretched dangerously thin on
time. There are bugs to fix, customers to close and any number of urgent existential fires that demand your full
attention. You know you should be spending more time on hiring but it's a battle to find it.

The bad news is even once you find the time, much of it will feel like wasted effort. Hiring isn't the kind of work that
provides you constant dopamine hits. It involves a lot of dead ends and frustration.

Start by being clear on what exactly you're looking for. I'd recommend listing all the specific criteria your dream hire
would have. This will be a combination of technical (are they a good engineer?) and non technical (would I work
productively with them?). Then mark each candidate you interview against all these criteria and rigorously debate if you
think they have enough strengths in some areas to make up for weaknesses in others.

In practice hiring decisions invariably involve tradeoffs. You could trade quality for speed by rejecting solid
candidates to wait for the dream one. Or you could trade money for time by paying a candidate above market rate to join
now. Founders should be aware of all these tradeoffs and make the one that's best for your circumstances.

Once you know what you're looking for, you're ready to start finding candidates. I'll go through the strategies
available, starting with what I believe is most effective and working through to the least.

*Note: As the founder of a hiring platform I'm not neutral in discussing their effectiveness. I have articulated both
their advantages and disadvantages and we did make our own first engineering hire through
*[*Triplebyte*](http://triplebyte.com/)*.*

## Personal Networks

This is the most important source by far. Once your startup scales it'll become less important as you'll have more
budget to spend on recruiting tools and building a recruiting team. At the start though it's where you should
exclusively focus your energy and only consider other sources when you've exhausted all possibilities here.

Hiring someone you've already worked with is your best option because you already know if you'll like working with them.
How much you enjoy working with any single person matters less as you grow larger but for your first hire it could be
the difference between persevering to success and shutting down the company. (Caveat: startups are also uniquely
stressful environments and there's still some probability you might not enjoy working with your friend under this kind
of stress as much as when you were both at a bigger company).

You'll also have a better chance to convince someone you know to take a risk and join you. Asking anyone to join as your
first hire is asking for an order of magnitude greater commitment than pitching an investor to invest. With personal
connections you'll know what would most motivate them to join and you can lean on friends to help convince them to make
the leap.

Yet I'm surprised by how often founders don't fully explore their personal networks for hiring. It's easy to be quick in
assuming that none of your friends are available before even asking them. It's understandable. Asking your friends to
leave their jobs and take a risk with you is scary. It's also more awkward to be rejected by your friends than
strangers. Still, if you're optimizing for the success of your startup you'll have to put this aside. Here's a plan you
could follow:

1.  Make a list of the best engineers you know, whether you think they're available or not. Go through your Facebook and
    LinkedIn to jog your memory.
2.  Invite them to lunch or dinner with them to talk about your startup.
3.  Make the ask - would you consider joining us?.
4.  Whatever they answer, ask a follow up question - if you did join us, which engineers would you most want to hire?.
5.  Ask for an introduction to those people.
6.  Repeat 2 - 5 with each of the introductions.
7.  Repeat 1 - 6 ad infinitum, I know public company founders who still do this. Expect to be spending at least a third
    of your time on this alone.

For your first three engineering hires I'd recommend focusing exclusively on personal network hiring. As your team grows
though you'll start thinking more about the composition and diversity of your team. Hiring through your personal network
usually isn't the best option for this and the larger a team grows the harder it becomes to change the balance. After
your first three hires, I'd suggest continue to work your personal network and supplementing with the strategies below
to meet candidates your own network wouldn't reach.

## Hiring Marketplaces

Newer recruiting startups like us (Triplebyte) and Hired operate as marketplaces. There's candidates on one side and
companies on the other. The value to candidates is increasing their number of options and to companies it's reducing
their time to make hires.

These marketplaces are strictly inferior to using personal networks for your first hire. The good ones can attract high
quality candidates but most will want to work somewhere that already has an engineering team. They also charge a fee per
hire that will usually be around $25,000 for an experienced engineer. Whether that's good value for you depends on how
much funding you've raised and how much founder time you'd have to spend on making that hire.

Candidates on these marketplaces are also speaking with multiple companies so you'll face competition. You can get
success though (we've had startups make their first hire on Triplebyte). Your results will depend heavily on how
effective your pitch and closing process is. I've seen a lot of variance in how effective companies are at this. An
engineer hired at [Gusto](http://gusto.com/) (YC W12) through Triplebyte
[blogged](https://kellysutton.com/2016/10/20/visualizing-a-job-search-or-how-to-find-a-job-as-a-software-engineer.html)
about how much difference there is between companies in just being responsive to him. To get the most from a hiring
marketplace you need a polished pitch for why your company is an exciting place to work and a speedy process for moving
them from first call to interview and offer.

Despite the disadvantages I still rank (good) hiring marketplaces as your second best option because they provide quick
access to a pool of vetted, skilled engineers. The candidates on these marketplaces are mostly motivated to move jobs
right now. You can quickly get on the phone to make your pitch and start interviewing the interested ones. This also
helps you practice and improve both your pitch and calibration on what exactly you're looking for. Getting better at
pitching will increase your success at hiring in general.

Some of the marketplaces will also do a rigorous technical evaluation of the candidates before accepting them onto the
marketplace. If that evaluation is done well, you can skip your own pre-onsite technical screening and expect a higher
conversion rate of onsite interviews to offer which saves you time. (The average direct to onsite to offer rate for
Triplebyte candidates is 40% vs the industry standard of 20%).

## Generate Inbound

As an early stage startup you likely won't get much organic inbound interest from good engineers. The quickest way to
generate this is posting on job sites. However most job sites aren't frequented by high-quality engineers. They'll get
you volume, not quality and volume alone isn't what you want. The majority of job applicants for any job posting are
below the bar and it creates more work for you to filter them. The job postings I would recommend trying are on sites
with a sizable engineering audience e.g. [Stack Overflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs), the monthly Hacker News
[‚ÄúWho is hiring?"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17442187) thread (Hacker News job postings themselves are only
available to YC companies) and [Angel List](https://angel.co/recruiting).

You can also create content that appeals to engineers to generate inbound interest. This is especially easy if you're
working on a particularly exciting idea e.g. self-driving cars. As soon as you publicly announce what you're doing
you'll get a burst of inbound applications. As this type of startup you'll always have a hiring advantage by having an
easier time getting press and building brand recognition.

Developer tool companies also have an advantage. Your product is already interesting to engineers and you should be
investing in writing good quality blog posts about it - both to attract customers and for hiring. Set a goal of writing
an article that's Hacker News front page worthy at least once a month.

If you're not either of these types of companies you can still blog about the technical choices you've made. Have you
made any controversial or unusual choices in your stack? If so, write about them. You may alienate some engineers who
disagree but you may also capture the full attention of a few who agree strongly e.g. Cognito have especially strong
views on testing and wrote about how they use mutation testing
(<https://blog.cognitohq.com/how-to-write-better-code-using-mutation-testing/>). Not only does this get the attention of
potential candidates, it creates content that you can also use include in cold outreach (more on that later).

A more time-intensive option is creating interactive content like coding challenges or puzzles, the Netflix algorithm
contest being the most famous example. This can definitely work, Robby Walker, founder of Cue (acquired by Apple), wrote
about how this worked well for them here
(<https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/08/programming-challenges-benefit-job-seekers-and-employers/>). It's a high-risk
strategy though. If you can't design something genuinely interesting then spending time on this will be a boondoggle. If
you're confident in your ability to make something interesting then go for it but run your idea by some engineering
friends first to see if it sparks interest.

Finally your inbound conversion will increase the higher quality your job posting is. Invest time in making it stand
out. Larger companies default to generic job postings that all look and sound the same (often because they're literally
using the same software to create them). As a startup you can do better. You could make your job posting personal by
writing in the first person as founder about why you started this company. You could use an informal tone that doesn't
read like corporate boilerplate. Experiment with what feels right but move away from blandness.

## Cold Outreach

Cold outreach is messaging engineers online. This could be on career/recruiting specific platforms like LinkedIn or
places where engineers spend time like Hacker News and GitHub. (One advantage a technical founding team has here is
they'll already know where the best places are to look).

The challenge with cold outreach, especially on recruiting-specific platforms like LinkedIn, is the overwhelming number
of messages good engineers receive on them. For your message to stand out from the crowd you need to put in work to make
it personalized. Greg Brockman has some great advice (<https://stripe.com/blog/startup-advice-cold-recruiting>) on this.

You'll also see a greater return if you can hunt down email addresses rather than sending messages. If you're looking at
profiles on LinkedIn, use the Connectifer (<https://www.connectifier.com/>) Chrome extension to get them. Otherwise do
what you can to find an email address (sometimes people include them in their forum profiles or try finding a personal
website that might have contact information). If you have any press articles or noteworthy mentions, I'd link to these
in the message too. You also need to follow up and expect it'll take two or three emails before you get a reply.

This approach is how the majority of technical hiring at larger companies is done. Teams of recruiters reach out to
candidates and optimize their messaging over time to get more responses. There are tools to help you with this
optimization e.g. Sourceress and ZenSourcer. If you send enough messages this approach will work and can result in great
hires. If you reach people just before they've started interviewing and move quickly, you'll have a much higher chance
of closing them.

The disadvantage is it's very time consuming and will feel draining. The majority of your messages won't get replied and
you'll be tempted to give up. You'll have to commit to spending a certain amount of time per day sending emails and
messages. One time saving trick you can consider is giving someone else access to your email and paying them to send the
messages on your behalf then you handle the replies. How comfortable you feel doing that is of course your call.

It's hard to estimate how quickly you might be able to hire through cold outreach. If you're lucky you could get the
right person in for an interview next week. More realistically, I'd expect this approach to take up to 6 months before
it results in a hire.

## Recruiters

Hiring a technical recruiter to make your first engineering hire is hard to make work. The strategy they'll probably use
is cold outreach and it's unlikely they'll achieve higher response rates than messages coming from a founder.

What a recruiter does have more of than you is time and focus. They can send more messages per day and this could get
more candidates replying if the gap between their effectiveness and yours is narrow enough. My recommendation if you go
down this route would be to find recruiters who work on a contract basis. You can agree on a rate per hour, how many
hours they'll work per week and for what period of time. Then if they're producing candidates, great. If not, you cancel
the contract. Anecdotally, I'm noticing a trend where more of the best recruiters at companies are starting to work as
independent contractors for multiple startups.

Before working with a recruiter make sure you've invested time in really training them on how to pitch your company
well. I'd give them all the information they need, give them a day to prepare and then ask them to pitch it back to you.
Only work with them if they do this well.

## Meetups

Meetups are difficult to rank on this list because their effectiveness has high variance depending on both the type of
event and the type of person you are. Meetups that are primarily business conferences with corporate sponsors who send
along some members of their IT department are almost certainly a complete waste of time. Smaller, informal meetups with
a deeply technical agenda where people bring laptops and code can be great. Even these will still only be an effective
strategy if you're either:

(1) An engineer who can gain the respect of other engineers through technical conversation. (2) A highly charismatic
personality

You need to honestly decide if you're either of these. If you're unsure whether you are (2), you probably aren't. If
you're (1) and tend to avoid group meetups, you'll have to get over this if you're the only technical founder.
Convincing engineers to join is one sales job you can't delegate entirely to your cofounder.

Even if you attend great technical meetups and you're the right type of personality, it's still unlikely you'll make a
good hire quickly through this channel. The better meetups have fewer people and they're primarily not there to find a
job. It's a good way to build a network of smart people, which will become valuable as you scale, but not a good bet to
solve your problem right now.

## Agencies

Traditional recruiting agencies tend to have bad adverse selection bias on the candidates they can engage. Most good
engineers won't work with them and the engineers that do are being sent out to as many companies as possible. I can't
think of a startup I know that made their first engineering hire through a recruiting agency. While I'm sure there are
counter examples, it's more likely using an agency will suck up a lot of your time with little ROI. The best agencies
tend to focus more on executive level hiring which won't be helpful for you.

## Conclusion

As I said at the start, hiring your first engineer is incredibly hard unless you're lucky enough to have a friend you
can convince to join. To make any other strategy work you need to treat hiring like you did fundraising and start by
refining your message and pitch. Candidates think differently to investors and you'll need to tweak the message that
worked for your fundraise e.g. candidates will think less about your market size and more about your most interesting
product challenges.

Once you understand what resonates most about your company with engineers you can switch gears to working through
channels to get that message out to potential candidates. Then be prepared for a lot of struggle and rejection until you
find the right person. Good luck\!

If there are any other strategies you've tried with success that should be added here, please do email me
([(redacted)](founder_link?slug=4H-how-to-hire-your-first-engineer)), I'd love to hear them.

We‚Äôd like to fund a lot more hard tech companies
[1](http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/), and I‚Äôd like to explain
how YC most helps hard tech founders.

At the earliest stages, there‚Äôs actually a lot more in common between a self-driving car company and a file sharing
company than people think‚Äìall kinds of startups usually work best when initial costs are low and iteration cycles are
fast. It‚Äôs relatively easy for a software startup to take short cycle times and low-costs to an extreme, but hard tech
founders are often surprised by how effectively they can do this, too.

Many hard tech founders come from academia or big company backgrounds, where projects can be expensive and slow. We help
these founders shift into a much more iterative mindset so they can move faster.

Very often, the first thing we do is help hard tech founders find a small project within their larger idea that fits the
model of quick iteration and requires a relatively small amount of capital. This project is often the smallest subset of
their technology that still matters to some user or customer. It may at first look like a detour, but it‚Äôs a starting
point that lets founders build measurable momentum‚Äìfor themselves, for recruiting employees, and for attracting
investors.

And while we encourage hard tech startups to start small, we love when founders think very big. ¬†When needed, we help
founders think through a long-term plan of how they can develop their technology to build companies of massive impact.
It‚Äôs not a YC company, but Tesla is my favorite example of how powerful this small project + long-term planning
mentality can be. Their vision has always been to bring an affordable electric car to the masses, but they first built
the Roadster‚Äîthe opposite of a mass market car‚Äîto generate revenue to get to the Model S. The Model S then generated the
revenue to start the Model 3.

And Oklo, which is building next generation nuclear reactors, is a promising example from YC. When they first came to
YC, they were considering going after several very different markets simultaneously. We encouraged them to focus on one
market they could enter quickly and not try to do too many things at once, but we also encouraged them to open up to
thinking through their most impactful possible future.

In terms of cost, we help hard tech startups operate as efficiently as possible. One factor that lead to the explosion
of internet startups was that web hosting became a couple of orders of magnitude cheaper and easier to do. This is
happening now for hard tech: there are many more standard components and services at much lower costs for startups in
biotech, energy, robotics, and everything in between. We help founders think about how to build their first version and
source components as quickly as possible, and we have deals with suppliers and service providers that you can use based
on your needs.

We also help hard tech startups balance the need to move quickly with complex regulatory environments. Hard tech
startups often operate in heavily regulated markets, and the activation energy required to get over regulatory hurdles
kills many of them. Even the most regulated industries have paths to quickly test your assumptions though, and we help
you find the best plan of attack without getting into trouble.

When appropriate, we help hard tech founders find customers. For some startups this doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîthere are some
ideas that people will obviously want if the technology can be figured out, and there are obvious other things to focus
on. But for others, it can be a useful way to find that smallest useful project and/or build more momentum.

Gingko Bioworks, which biologically engineers custom microbes, is a good example of this‚Äî before YC they had done a few
large deals, with long \~6 month sales cycles. But when they went through YC, we encouraged them to figure out how to do
minimal sized engagements that they could sell more quickly. During YC, they took this strategy and closed 3 new
Fortune-1000 sized customers. They say this strategy gave them a lot of momentum to keep building on to where they are
[now](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/ginkgo-bioworks-grabs-100-million-in-financing-to-buy-a-whole-lot-of-synthetic-dna/).

Hard tech companies go through the same 3-month batch format as all of the startups we fund. No matter what people are
working on, it ends up being very motivating to be around other founders for this short, intense period of time. And
during the batch, hard tech founders have hardware and biotech days, where companies come together to hear from
successful founders on how to best tackle their specific problems.

Hard tech companies also join the same 3,000-person-plus YC alumni network as all of our startups. The network is just
as useful for a hard tech company as any other startup‚Äîalumni are resources for advice, recruiting, and serve as first
customers. For example, Transcriptic, which operates a robotic laboratory for outsourced science experiments, offers
$20k in credits to every YC biotech company that wants to use their service. This both helps other YC companies, and
turns them into customers that Transcriptic can grow with as their customers' businesses scale.

Alumni and batchmates also give moral support‚Äîmore so than with others, we hear from hard tech founders how isolating a
startup can be; problems are difficult and payout can be very long-term. Having a group of other founders going through
the same things can help a lot.

Finally, we are particularly good at helping hard tech companies raise money. Fundraising can often be harder for hard
tech founders, as the things being worked on often fall outside investors' comfort zones. But at this point a lot of
investors take YC's judgement as an encouraging sign. Being backed by YC can help legitimize daunting ideas.

We hope to fund a lot more hard tech companies in the future, and if you‚Äôre tinkering on something or even just toying
with an idea, we hope you‚Äôll [apply now](http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/), even if that means you have to turn in your
application late. There will be many $10 billion+ hard tech companies in the future, and we hope to help a lot more of
them get started.

[1](http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/) I use¬†‚Äòhard tech‚Äô to
mean a startup where there is doubt that the technology can be built at all.

[32m2024-02-05 20:11:17 +0100[0m - dagster - [34mINFO[0m - __ASSET_JOB - aa86ea93-ffee-453e-b9b0-7056271dbf6c - chunked_blog_docs - A lot of the advice we give startups is tactical; meant to be helpful on a day to day or week to week basis. But some
advice is more fundamental. We‚Äôve collected here what we at YC consider the most important, most transformative advice
for startups. Whether common sense or counter-intuitive, the guidance below will help most startups find their path to
success.

The first thing we always tell founders is to launch their product right away; for the simple reason that this is the
only way to fully understand customers‚Äô problems and whether the product meets their needs. Surprisingly, launching a
mediocre product as soon as possible, and then talking to customers and iterating, is much better than waiting to build
the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù product. This is true as long as the product contains a ‚Äúquantum of utility‚Äù for customers whose value
overwhelms problems any warts might present.

Once launched, we suggest founders do things that don‚Äôt scale ([Do Things That Don‚Äôt
Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) by Paul Graham<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>). Many
startup advisors persuade startups to scale way too early. This will require the building of technology and processes to
support that scaling, which, if premature, will be a waste of time and effort. This strategy often leads to failure and
even startup death. Rather, we tell startups to get their first customer by any means necessary, even by manual work
that couldn‚Äôt be managed for more than ten, much less 100 or 1000 customers. At this stage, founders are still trying to
figure out what needs to be built and the best way to do that is talk directly to customers. For example, the Airbnb
founders originally offered to ‚Äúprofessionally‚Äù photograph the homes and apartments of their earliest customers in order
to make their listings more attractive to renters. Then, they went and took the photographs themselves. The listings on
their site improved, conversions improved, and they had amazing conversations with their customers. This was entirely
unscalable, yet proved essential in learning how to build a vibrant marketplace.

Talking to users usually yields a long, complicated list of features to build. One piece of advice that YC partner Paul
Buchheit (PB) always gives in this case is to look for the ‚Äú90/10 solution‚Äù. That is, look for a way in which you can
accomplish 90% of what you want with only 10% of the work/effort/time. If you search hard for it, there is almost always
a 90/10 solution available. Most importantly, a 90% solution to a real customer problem which is available right away,
is much better than a 100% solution that takes ages to build.

As companies begin to grow there are often tons of potential distractions. Conferences, dinners, meeting with venture
capitalists or large company corporate development types ([Don‚Äôt Talk to Corp
Dev](http://www.paulgraham.com/corpdev.html) by Paul Graham<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>),
chasing after press coverage and so on. (YC co-founder Jessica Livingston created a pretty comprehensive list of the
wrong things on which to focus \[[How Not To Fail](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-not-to-fail/) by Jessica Livingston
<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>.\]) We always remind founders not to lose sight that the most
important tasks for an early stage company are to write code and talk to users. For any company, software or otherwise,
this means that in order to make something people want: you must launch something, talk to your users to see if it
serves their needs, and then take their feedback and iterate. These tasks should occupy almost all of your time/focus.
For great companies this cycle never ends. Similarly, as your company evolves there will be many times where founders
are forced to choose between multiple directions for their company. Sam Altman always points out that it is nearly
always better to take the more ambitious path. It is actually extraordinary how often founders manage to avoid tackling
these sorts of problems and focus on other things. Sam calls this ‚Äúfake work‚Äù, because it tends to be more fun than real
work ([The Post YC Slump](http://blog.samaltman.com/the-post-yc-slump) by Sam
Altman<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>).

When it comes to customers most founders don‚Äôt realize that they get to choose customers as much as customers get to
choose them. We often say that a small group of customers who love you is better than a large group who kind of like
you. In other words, recruiting 10 customers who have a burning problem is much better than 1000 customers who have a
passing annoyance. It is easy to make mistakes when choosing your customers so sometimes it‚Äôs also critical for startups
to fire their customers<sup id="footnoteid6"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>. Some customers can cost way more than
they provide in either revenue or learning. For example, Justin.tv/Twitch only became a breakout success when they
focused their efforts toward video game broadcasters and away from people trying to stream copy written content ([Users
You Don‚Äôt Want](http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/users-you-don-t-want) by Michael
Seibel<sup id="footnoteid7"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>.)

Growth is always a focus for startups, since a startup without growth is usually a failure. However, how and when to
grow is often misunderstood. YC is sometimes criticised for pushing companies to grow at all costs, but in fact we push
companies to talk to their users, build what they want, and iterate quickly. Growth is a natural result of doing these
three things successfully. Yet, growth is not always the right choice. If you have not yet made something your customers
want - in other words, have found product market fit, it makes little sense to grow ([The Real Product Market
Fit](http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/the-real-product-market-fit) by Michael
Seibel<sup id="footnoteid8"><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>). Poor retention is always the result. Also, if you have an
unprofitable product, growth merely drains cash from the company. As PB likes to say, it never makes sense to take 80
cents from a customer and then hand them a dollar back. The fact that unit economics really matter shouldn‚Äôt come as a
surprise, but too many startups seem to forget this basic fact ([Unit
Economics](http://blog.samaltman.com/unit-economics) by Sam
Altman<sup id="footnoteid9"><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup>).

Startup founders‚Äô intuition will always be to do more whereas usually the best strategy is almost always to do less,
really well. For example, founders are frequently tempted to chase big deals with large companies which represent
amazing, company validating relationships. However, deals between large companies and tiny startups seldom end well for
the startup. They take too long, cost too much, and often fail completely. One of the hardest things about doing a
startup is choosing what to do, since you will always have an infinite list of things that could be done ([Startup
Priorities](http://blog.geoffralston.com/startup-priorities) by Geoff
Ralston<sup id="footnoteid10"><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>). It is vital that very early a startup choose the one or
two key metrics it will use to measure success, then founders should choose what to do based nearly exclusively on how
the task will impact those metrics. When your early stage product isn‚Äôt working it's often tempting to immediately build
new features in order to solve every problem the customer seems to have instead of talking to the customer and focusing
only on the most acute problem they have.

Founders often find it surprising to hear that they shouldn‚Äôt worry if their company seems badly broken. It turns out
that nearly every startup has deep, fundamental issues, even those that will end up being billion dollar companies.
Success is not determined by whether you are broken at the beginning, but rather what the founders do about the
inevitable problems. Your job as a founder will often seem to be continuously righting a capsized ship. This is normal.

It is very difficult as a new startup founder not to obsess about competition, actual and potential. It turns out that
spending any time worrying about your competitors is nearly always a very bad idea. We like to say that startup
companies always die of suicide not murder. There will come a time when competitive dynamics are intensely important to
the success or failure of your company, but it is highly unlikely to be true in the first year or two.

A few words on fundraising ([A Guide to Seed Fundraising](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/) by
Geoff Ralston<sup id="footnoteid11"><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>). The first, best bit of advice is to raise money
as quickly as possible and then get back to work. It is often easy to actually see when a company is fundraising by
looking at their growth curve and when it flattens out they are raising money. Equally important is to understand that
valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success ([Fundraising Rounds are not
Milestones](https://blog.ycombinator.com/fundraising-rounds-are-not-milestones/) by Michael
Seibel<sup id="footnoteid12"><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup>). Some of Y Combinator‚Äôs very best companies raised on
tiny initial valuations (Airbnb, Dropbox, Twitch, are all good examples). By the way, it is vital to remember that the
money you raise IS NOT your money. You have a fiduciary and ethical/moral duty to spend the money only to improve the
prospects of your company.

It is also important to stay sane during the inevitable craziness of startup life. So we always tell founders to make
sure they take breaks, spend time with friends and family, get enough sleep and exercise in between bouts of
extraordinarily intense, focused work. Lastly, a brief word on failure. It turns out most companies fail fast because
founders fall out. The relationships with your cofounders matter more than you think and open, honest communications
between founders makes future debacles much less likely. In fact, it turns out that one of the best things you can do to
make your startup successful, in fact, to be successful in life, is to simply be nice ([Mean People
Fail](http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html) by Paul Graham<sup id="footnoteid13"><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup>.)

a lot of this from the final lecture I gave in [How To Start a Startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/).

**Management**  
Before product/market fit, your number one job is to build a great product. But as your company grows past \~25
employees, your main job shifts from building a great product to building a great company.

There is very little management in the beginning, and that actually works well. When there are fewer than \~20
employees, most companies have everyone report to the founder. That's optimal in the early stage.

But what works well at 20 employees can be disastrous at 40. You want to be aware that you will need structure in place
before it‚Äôs painfully necessary.

You shouldn‚Äôt make the structure complicated. To start, all you need is for every employee to know who their manager is
and for everyone to have exactly one manager. Every manager should know who their direct reports are, and you should try
to cluster people into teams that make sense.

Clarity and simplicity are important‚ÄìI wouldn't try to innovate on management structure. Don't make it complicated or
convoluted. It‚Äôs also really important to have a clear mission and clear goals‚Äì the better job you do with these, the
less management will feel overbearing.

Beyond structure, there are a few other management cases where founders often fail:

*Senior People:* In the early days, hiring senior people is usually a mistake. As the company starts to scale though,
it‚Äôs actually valuable to add senior people/executives to the team that have built companies before. Don't be afraid
to do this.

*Not Delegating:* As companies start to scale, many founders take on too much personally instead of assigning work to
other people. This can work for a while, but as your company keeps growing, you become stretched thin and things get
done poorly. It's really important to delegate work and hire needed people as you approach your breaking points.

*Delegating Poorly:* Many founders try to delegate by having employees do all the grunt work, but then still try to make
all the decisions. This doesn't work well‚Äìboth for scalability, and for making your employees most effective. Instead,
empower employees to make their own decisions. Let them know how you think about a problem, but let them own the
decision process. You should feel comfortable trusting them if you've hired the right people.

If done right, it‚Äôs safe to delegate most things; especially delegate the stuff you don‚Äôt want to do. Try not to
delegate the one thing you really want to remain involved with though‚Äìif it‚Äôs something you enjoy or think will benefit
a lot from having you involved, you‚Äôll be more satisfied.

*Personal Organization:* It's really important to develop a way to keep track of what you need to do and what you need
to follow up on with others. It's not critical to figure this out when you're just starting out and focusing on product,
but it's crucial as you become a manager.

*Communicating:* After a certain point you can't have one-on-one conversations with everyone. To handle this, learn to
communicate in clear, succinct writing, and share it with everyone. It's one of the highest leverage things you can do,
and it scales to thousands of people. ‚ÄòAll hands‚Äô meetings with all employees at least once a month can be a really
effective way to communicate too, and it‚Äôs still a really good idea to have one-on-ones with your direct reports.

**HR**  
Most founders ignore HR in the first phase of a startup, but it‚Äôs a huge mistake to continue ignoring it as you
transition to a later stage. Good HR will help you scale much faster.

Good HR means three things: a clear management structure, a way for people to talk about workplace issues and concerns,
and pathways for people to evolve in their careers.

An important component of creating pathways is performance feedback. It can be light, but it should happen frequently.
It helps people a lot when people can regularly hear how they are doing--good or bad.

It should also be clear how performance ties to compensation. People talk, and they will eventually find out co-workers'
compensation levels. If it's all over the place, it can be a complete disaster. Compensation bands let people know how
much they should fairly be making‚Äìfor example, a mid-level engineer will know she falls in a certain range, and a senior
engineer in another. They keep things fair and help avoid a lot of crazy negotiation.

Equity is also a very important component of compensation. YC company data suggests that most successful companies give
out a lot of equity.

I typically tell founders that they should plan to give away 3-5% of their company each year for the ten years from
founding. It's a lot of stock but you should be doing this to keep your people motivated and aligned.

It's also a really good idea to do this with [refresher
grants](https://blog.wealthfront.com/how-long-should-you-stay-at-your-job/) for existing employees approaching their
vesting cliffs, and you should get a plan in place for this early. You never want an employee in a place where they
start thinking about leaving because they‚Äôve vested three out of their four years.Always stay in front of people's'
vesting schedules.

In preparation for the longer term, make sure to monitor your team for burnout. Building a company really is a marathon
and you cannot sustain people working 100 hour weeks in perpetuity. You want them to go on vacation, have new
challenges, and do new things.

If things are going well, the 12-24 month mark is also a good time to put in place a hiring process. And once you have
product/market fit (but not sooner), you should hire a full-time recruiter‚Äìgetting the best people is arguably the most
important thing to do, and you want to be as effective at this as possible.

A couple other HR tips:

*Build a Diverse Team:* Even before the 12-24 month mark, it's worth thinking about how to build a team of diverse
perspectives. You want unity of vision, but diversity of backgrounds is good. Myopic culture is typically less
effective.

*Announce Offers:* Up to a few hundred employees, try announcing every potential job offer on an internal mailing list.
If you do it, very often someone in the company will know something good or bad about the prospective employee.

*Structure Onboarding:* Have a program in place to ramp up new employees. That way when someone starts, you know what
their first week looks like and how they‚Äôll be trained.

*Build Paths for Early Employees:* As a company grows, you want to be very proactive in thinking what the path may be
for the original 10 to 15 employees. They may not be appropriate for newly needed executive roles, but you want them to
be happy‚Äìthey're probably loved by their peers, and very productive. So be proactive and talk to them about their path
very directly. Sit down with them and ask how they want their careers inside the company to progress.

**Company Productivity**  
Building a company that is able to innovate repeatedly is the hardest thing in business. Most companies do one great
thing then stop innovating. Great founders work very hard to overcome this.

Alignment is key‚Äìcompanies become unproductive because people are either not on the same page, or they don't understand
the priorities. If you can keep the entire team aligned in the same direction, you have won over half the battle.

Start getting there with a very clear mission, roadmap, and goals. Everyone in the company should know what the roadmap
is for the next 3-6 months or even a year.

There‚Äôs a classic test I love to give companies struggling with scaling‚Äì I'll ask the founders a simple question: ‚ÄúIf I
asked 10 employees what the top three goals are for the company, would they say the same thing?" 100 percent of the time
the founders say yes. I'll then go and do it, and 100 percent of the time no two employees say the same thing.

Founders are always surprised by this because they think they communicate their ideas effectively. In reality, they‚Äôre
not communicating their ideas as clearly or as frequently as they should. It's critical to make a habit of reiterating
your roadmap and goals so people can understand and internalize them.

Similarly, transparent communication is really important. It‚Äôs critical for founders to have a management meeting with
direct reports every week. it‚Äôs a good idea to have all hands meetings with the entire company at least once a month.
Use these to go through the roadmap of the entire company, the immediate three month trajectory, and how the immediate
trajectory plays into the longer term goals.

Other longer term productivity tips

*Do Offsites:* Take your best people outside the normal workspace for a weekend where everyone has time to just talk and
think through the bigger picture. People have interesting ideas when they‚Äôre out of the day-to-day.

*Get Legal Docs in Order:* If you assign someone to go through and collect every agreement that the company has ever
signed, you will save a lot of future headaches.

*Start Doing Financial Planning and Analysis (FP\&A):* If you have someone build a really great model of the business,
you can optimize and understand how things are working at a level that most people totally miss. Most people don't hire
someone to work on this until they have a few hundred employees, but it‚Äôs worth doing sooner.

*Hire a Fundraiser:* A full-time fundraiser is another role I think is worth hiring much earlier than most recommend. If
you hire someone really great after your B round and their full-time job is to prepare for the C round, you‚Äôll almost
certainly get better results than if you hire an investment banker later on. You'll also end up paying way less money
and take a much smaller dilution.

*Pay Attention to Unit Economics:* Sooner rather than later, you need to figure out how to make more money from each
user than you spend. Most great companies historically have had good unit economics soon after they began monetizing,
even if the company as a whole lost money for a long period of time. It can be tempting to paper over a problem with the
business by spending more money instead of fixing the product or service, but this is a major trap.

*Watch Your Runway:* Even if unit economics look great, you‚Äôve got to make sure there‚Äôs money in the bank. Don‚Äôt ever
get down to just a couple months of cash in the bank.

**Founder Psychology**  
As you keep working on your company, it will almost certainly get harder. The highs are higher but the lows keep getting
lower.

As you become more successful, people start rooting against you. Journalists and people on the internet will find ways
to pick apart what you're doing, and it sucks to read. Early on, you‚Äôve got to figure out how to ignore the haters.

Also early on, it's good to start thinking about how long a journey your startup will be. Very few founders make an
actual long term commitment to what they're building, and the ones that do have a huge advantage. Have a strategy that
assumes you will work on your company for the next 10 years--it can be an extreme advantage that few founders leverage.

And remember to take vacation yourself. We often see founders that go three or four years without ever taking a real
vacation. That may work for a year or two, but you will burn out.

Finally, don't lose focus. Focus is what made you successful in the first place. There are a lot of reasons people lose
focus--burnout is certainly one, and talking to potential acquirers is another very dangerous one. Don‚Äôt become
distracted.

**Marketing & PR**  
We tell companies to ignore marketing and PR for a long time. Press will not make your startup.

But, as you start to be successful, it becomes something that founders need to spend time on. Once your product is
working, switch from not caring about it to caring about it a little bit.

Never outsource the key messaging of the company to a PR firm or your head of marketing. You should figure out what the
message of the company is going to be yourself.

I'd also recommend getting to know key journalists. No journalist wants to talk to a PR firm; they're much happier to
hear from the founder. Pick three or four journalists that you develop really close relationships with that like and
understand you, then contact them yourself; they'll actually pay attention and care about the company.

**Dealmaking**  
12-24 months in is also when business development can start to matter. This certainly assumes though that you've already
built a great product.

If you're getting into business development deals, make sure to develop personal connections with whomever you're trying
to do big deals with. No one wants to feel like they're being used transactionally, so make sure to show you actually
care about the person you're dealing with.

That said, make sure you set up competitive situations. This is a basic principle of negotiation, and most founders
learn this from fundraising. You get good terms and deals done when you have a competitive situation and you stay
persistent.

The final point I'll make is that you have to ask for what you want. If you want something in a deal, don‚Äôt be afraid to
say so. Most of the time you won't get laughed out of the room, and you might actually get it.

It‚Äôs worth saying again‚Äìthe later-stage is a different beast than when you first start your company, and you need to be
aware of that. Pay close attention to when you cross that point, and put things in place accordingly.

In a nutshell, have clear, simply-structured management that people understand. Set up ways for people to advance their
careers and be rewarded. Make sure to focus on what most needs your attention, and get good at delegating what doesn‚Äôt.
Communicate clearly within the company, and set a roadmap so people know where to point their efforts.

There‚Äôs obviously a lot to it, but keeping these in-mind can help a lot. And again, don‚Äôt worry about these things when
you‚Äôre starting out‚Äìstay focused on making a great product.

It was so good that we wanted to share it here.

Enjoy\!

-----

**If you were starting a new game company today, assuming all other conditions and game mechanics, retention, were
equal, and UA costs were the biggest decision factor, would you: A) Develop your own IP B) Use public domain IP like
Sherlock, similar to your Camelot game C) spend money at market rate to license a hot/the hottest IP you can like an
upcoming movie D) spend money to license a less hot IP that has been sitting around**

If UA costs are big factor, I would work to reduce the CAC as much as possible. If you don't have as much money, I would
use a public domain IP like B - in fact this is the exact reason why our first game we chose the Camelot theme - it was
public domain and market accessible.

**Are there any great mobile UA resources or channels that are cheaper/undervalued, but overlooked because they perhaps
don't scale for the big players?**

Unscalable UA channels overlooked are any of the ones that tend to be more grassroots. I would consider looking at
forums, reddit , Discord etc... I don't know which one will work the best for you, but go to where the potential gamers
are at.

**Mobile games are notoriously hard to raise money for, understandably, and also require a fair amount of capital to
experiment with. Where should mobile game founders go to find investors?**

Yes they are hard to raise money for\! If you have the means, bootstrap the game\! If not, there are a couple of ways to
raise capital especially if you have a team or pedigree to raise money. You can go on Angellist to find founders who
were in gaming still investing. There is also a list of VCs here for Series A:
<https://signal.nfx.com/vc_lists/top-games-series-a-investors>

And a plug for my friends at <https://www.fig.co> - if you want to crowd fund your game.

**Is product market fit thought of differently in mobile games? Is it more retention based than "people are beating a
path to your door/demand is exploding"? Seems many breakout mobile games are more the result of game with good retention
and great UA strategy than they are about releasing it and it "taking off"**

It's much closer to player / market fit. And it's closer to consumer - if you have your servers melting, you have
product market fit. But when you first release your game, definitely drive a small amount of traffic to it (few
thousand) in your target and work on your retention numbers, then I would start driving more traffic once retention is
good.

**Can you tell us more about how you see the future of mobile gaming (Hyper casual to High-core)? Do you see gaming
ecosystems and how big companies (Facebook, Twitch, Google, Apple etc) are thinking about it?**

So I may be jaded here, but because mobile has become more mature, I think the ones that make it a big hit will tend
towards more core and niche than casual. This does not mean that the theme cannot be casual, but mechanics will likely
be core. This is because content is so readily available that it is easy for someone to leave quickly, which is what
casual tends to do more of. Even all the popular casual games definitely loop in more core mechanics - progression,
player level ups, etc...

In terms of gaming ecosystems - I'm a big believer in growing platforms provide gaming ecosystems. I think the larger
ones (except twitch) focus on platform for all types of applications and not just gaming. It's just that people love
games and the highest revenue generating app tends to be games on any given platform. I think this is how PC games and
mobile games are able to get their start. I do think there is still room for console or some type of hardware (VR?)
gaming, but getting mass adoption will be difficult until you can reduce barriers of entry.

**A little long-winded question: Sam Altman and others have said in the past that 'starting a hard startup is easier in
the long run than starting an easy startup'. Which means, if you're solving a hard problem for people, initially it can
be painful, but gets better over time because more people will be motivated to join you, invest in you, and be part of
your mission. I worked for one such company for many years, and it was well worth it. Now, I was into game development
growing up, and I got back into it in recent past with some potentially good ideas. But I started struggling to motivate
myself because of questions like 'it's not real value to people', 'it's not impactful to society' popping up in my head
all the time. It felt like making games wasn't akin to solving a real problem for anyone. Do you ever struggle with such
questions as a game designer? Do you think gaming companies have a disadvantage in terms of, 1) how much lasting value
they actually bring to people, and 2) how much talent they can attract as a result? How do you get around this? And
what's your opinion on communities like gamesforchange.org that are trying to mix in game development with societal
impact?**

I get questions all the time about what I'm doing is frivolous. I absolutely disagree.

1.  This is how human beings learn and behave. Most people who tell me how they don't like games or play games - I am
    absolutely astonished and say "well I think there hasn't been a game made for you." \<= AND this coming from someone
    who did not grow up in the gaming industry OR as a gamer. Games are how we learn and connect. The first game a human
    being plays is peek-a-boo he/she is learning "object permanence".

2.  Ever notice that building a great gaming company can come from anywhere in the world? You have amazing game makers
    in every continent. To make a Hollywood blockbuster movie, you should go to Hollywood. To build a big tech company
    you should go to Silicon Valley. But not games - you don't need to leave. This to me drives home point \#1.

3.  Games obviously solve a real problem for people or else they would not be spending time on there. This is the
    hardest problems of all, because usually what games are solving are not tangible - they are problems of loneliness,
    loss of purpose, sense of low worth, boredom, lack of motivation, and yes even physical pain.Countless people use
    games to solve all those problems.

4.  Games is entertainment. It goes a step further in that it is interactive entertainment. In entertainment you get the
    privilege to influence culture. People cannot be what they cannot see, as game makers we enable them to not just see
    (and be) what they cannot see. Help them see the greater good in themselves as a game maker.

I can go on and on... but those are some of my initial thoughts.

Games drive forward adoption of technology, they are the forefront of change, and I think its' up to game makers to be
responsible with that power. That is how you make lasting change.

My general sense of games + social impact: I certainly think games for social impact make sense, but you have make that
into a game in it of itself and not really tell players it's for social impact and then surprise them\! what if Pokemon
go was about exercise, that would be no fun\!\!

**1. When you first started, how you dealt with spam/bad content in the community? What policies, mechanisms you and
your team implemented? (anything besides manually scanning the content).**

**2. Did you used social media to grow the community? If so, what did you do? Do you consider social media an effective
way to grow a community? When the value of the product lays in the community, it is hard to start.**

I felt like I started 3 companies in the last 11 years, but I will try to answer the most relevant experience to you
question.

1.  We had an admin tool for our fan communities and appointed officers to help us clean content. We did do it manually
    but we outsourced it to officers. For our games, we created some tools to help within the chat rooms to enable
    others to mute others and then eventually automated the prevention of spam.

2.  When we were early on Facebook for our fan communities we went into existing groups to tell people to install our
    application. When we did our mobile games we spent most of our time with UA - mainly because it was cheap. UA is
    really good when it's an untapped channel but hard to grow. Now with UA being so expensive, I would consider doing
    grass roots social media.

**How to model games where "Player exp" will potentially decrease?**

**Many "games" start from level 0, then the player exp/levels grow monotonically, so players can feel the rewards for
their effort.**

**What about the other type of "games" - think Fitness tracker, flashcard memory apps, that players actually start
somewhere, and if they stop they actually go backwards. Giving them reward points for progress itself might be
misleading - they actually gain weight / forgot, say. While punishing them & deducting their exp could be frustrating.**

Within games there are other things that start with a number and decrease (instead of the other way)  
1\. Energy - often times I'm limited by the number of lives like in Candy Crush  
2\. I usually start with a \# of coins and I need to use it over time  
3\. In many pet and sim games, if I do not take care of them, they die  
4\. Limited number of actions (spins) done in a day

**My startup is a gamified Q\&A app where a global community of language learners practice by checking each other's
writings. Our gamification consists of leveling up, unlocking features and earning virtual currency that can be used to
buy power ups. There's some social interaction that consists mostly of users following and helping each other.**

**1. Given that we have to prioritize features, in general, how do you know when it's a good time to build gamification
features over building social features, or vice versa?**

**2. Some of our users are a bit upset about having to unlock features, but we use this as a motivation for them to help
others (everything is free). Do you have any tip on how to make users see unlockable features in a positive light?**

**3. We have avoided adding paid features because we fear this could create an stratified community where things are not
earned by merit alone. Is there a good way to charge for extra features without affecting the dynamics of the
community?**

1.  I'm not sure the difference between the gamification features and social features? How does someone level up and how
    can they use their power ups?

2.  Sometimes you can give them a sample of what the feature is unlocked and lock it more based off of the second time
    they use it. Almost give a free trial so they know what they are trying to unlock.

3.  You can charge for things that do not impact whatever they need to earn points or level up. You can limit the number
    of things someone can get checked and then charge them money, split that money with the translator. In a game like
    League of Legends they only charge for skins or cosmetic things so as not to impact the core of the game.

**What are your thoughts on virtual reality gaming? Do you think it will go mainstream and if so what is your prediction
to when?**

Ah, opining on VR\! A favorite past time of a gamers and techies.

I think right now the VR gear is to cumbersome for it to be mainstream. You have to set up a whole rig and room. Compare
that to the phone, where you just have to pull it out of your pocket and start playing. On top of that, most of the
content I see for VR is just not that great. So I'm going to gear myself up, look more than an idiot than I already look
for less of an experience? No thank you.

I liken it to a bit of snorkeling vs. scuba diving. Snorkeling is much more accessible to the masses, less gear and less
training. I can see some really great things. But if I want to see even better things, I need to learn how to scuba
dive, put up the gear and prep a lot more\! The content just better be worth it.

I do eventually think it will go mainstream if it can solve some of the usability issues and phenomenal content on the
other side.

**1. Do you see e-sports or e-sports betting as markets with exponential growth?**

**2. Which e-sports platform or game has the gamers that are most obsessed with statistics or live statistics?**

e-Sports has a larger audience than NFL. That's pretty crazy\!

1.  Yes e-sports is definitely a growing industry.

2.  I do think betting can be big - my issue with betting is it's been so regulation heavy in the US and have seen it
    kill regular sports betting companies (a la Fan Duel)

3.  Not sure.

**What would you do if your product was engaging and fun, but didn't have enough k-factor or new users to scale to
meaningful size organically? How long do you iterate versus try something new?**

I am assuming that the monetization strategy is ads or something with a lot of audience and that usage is important. If
that is the case, I would give it 3-6 months iterating to crack the k-factor and then consider moving on.

**We are building facebook messenger chatbots for restaurants for getting new customers and re-engaging existing
customers. We have gamification as a core part of our user acquisition and retention strategy. We are using contests
like Spin the wheel (variable rewards) and steal of the day (fixed rewards) to acquire restaurant customers on the
chatbot.**

**We will also be using variable reward based games as a way to increase customer loyalty for restaurants. For instance,
we will send out a message saying your spin has recharged, spin and see what you get. Along with this we are also
building a gamified referral system with a social aspect. My questions are:**

**1. What are some best practices of building product retention using gamification?**

**2. In your experience, what are the key elements of a gamified reward system which make it addictive? For instance, I
really admire Google Tez scratch cards as a product feature.**

**3. Are there any resources you would recommend to gain deep insights into gamification?**

1.  I don't think gamification builds retention. I think the core of your product needs to be retentive and sticky.
    Facebook does a great job at creating a core loop first and then giving you signals and gamifying it.

2.  I'm not familiar with Google Tez scratch cards, but in a non-game, I think creating a core loop of a behavior that
    can become a habit. Games work differently in that they set a core loop and the game is the purpose, whereas your
    purpose maybe different entirely.

3.  I would consider a lot of work from BJ Fogg to help.

<https://www.bjfogg.com> as well as Dan Ariely: <http://danariely.com>

P.S. Bonus article: <https://medium.com/startup-grind/do-this-one-thing-to-make-your-product-sticky-aa8ed6d55797>

**We cofounded queue.gg, which is a marketplace that lets gamers hire coaches for 1:1 online coaching and replay
feedback. We're pretty excited that someone from the gaming industry is doing an AMA here\!**

**1. How can we combat cyberbullying in online gaming? Gamers are notorious for talking crap to each other and sometimes
creates a toxic enough environment to the point a shooting happens (the recent Madden shooting) or swatting.**

**2. Can you tell us what your goals were when you oversaw the worldwide People and Culture function?**

**3. Coaching in e-sports is still uncommon and not a norm in society. How can we change that?**

Congrats on launching\!

1.  I think there are a couple of reasons why gamers can get out of hand: 1. usually highly achievement zero-sum
    oriented games, you attract competitive people 2. Layer on anonymity and it can become a place that is really
    difficult. If you are a game developer or a platform you can enact decency rules or better yet penalize players that
    go too far. I can't find the article but I think LoL implemented a user tribune to help combat poor user behavior.
    This was several years ago I remember reading about that. In terms of the Madden shooting, I'm very very sad about
    that and I personally think it's related to a larger problem that is not applied to gamers.

2.  The people and culture function was related company building. Once you get product market fit, company building is
    your second job as founder. Our goals were very aligned with the business and would change as the business would
    change. An example of this is we needed to focus on building a long term relationship with the customer, from the
    culture side, we saw that our only metric of the customer that was shared widely was revenue. This was not a great
    way to build a relationship with our customers. So we began looking at other metrics such as retention , alliances
    and also added in qualitative ways to build a better relationship with our customers.

3.  I think e-Sports needs to become more mature. Once there is a clearer paths of longevity like the NBA or the NFL
    then all the support and feeder leagues can happen. Right now it's a growing but not fully mature field. This is
    what makes it exciting\!

**I'm keen to know more about user behaviour insights and learnings from Kabam, corporate social network.**

**Specifically, what motivated people to engage and initiate new discussions among peers? And you were to do this again,
how differently you will do it?**

**At my startup, StackRaft, we are re-thinking professional social graphs to connect people with global and remote
opportunities.**

With the corporate social network we had very little traction. In our opinion it was because people did NOT want to keep
talking about work when they were done with with work. They were at work to work, not socialize.

If I were to do it again, I would find something that they wanted to do and tie it with what they needed. As we are
moving towards a gig and freelancer economy, I do think a social network that is wider than the company may make sense.
These people are always looking for the next job and their company is themselves.

**I'm actually building a mobile game. Targeted at kids and using voice as a component. My main question is what is the
best way to test, validate and market your game on a shoe-string startup budget. I'd love your thoughts on my game if
you had time as well.**

Here are some initial ideas:

1.  Recruit friends with kids and see if you can do a "playdate" with them - offer free child care or offer it as a
    class\! Parents of toddlers are always looking for ways to entertain.
2.  Go to the library and offer it as a class for toddlers
3.  Create a signup list for the beta
4.  Infiltrate some facebook groups and recruit users there.

Hope that helps\!

P.S. I've assumed that this is a game for toddlers because of the name.

**We‚Äôre on a mission to connect the human brain to the computer using an AI-powered headset device. We‚Äôre currently
exploring potential applications for our product in the gaming industry and I‚Äôm more than happy to have the opportunity
to ask you a few questions.**

**1) What do you think is the next big thing in the gaming industry when it comes to character control?**

**2) Do you think that adapting a game content based on physiological signals might be a good idea at all?**

**3) Do you envision any disruptive innovations in improving the video game console (components, electronics and/or any
other hardware-related improvements to be made), controllers/joystick upgrades, etc. happening soon?**

**4) Are you familiar with any gaming studio company that is experimenting with hard tech innovations or products at the
moment?**

1.  Funny enough, I'm bullish on voice as the next big gaming platform. Mainly because it's immersive and so easy to get
    into.

2.  Could be really interesting\!

3.  I certainly think the more you can remove barriers of entry the greater mass adoption will be. I honestly think
    consoles and controllers and terribly unusable. This is how I think mobile gaming was one of the reasons it could
    grow so fast

4.  A YC company called Plexus is creating a smart glove, but they re not a gaming studio. There are a ton more YC
    companies that are hard tech innovations, less with gaming.

**1. Why didn't the social network for corporates work? and how did you pivot from fan communities to mobile gaming?
Especially what made you or helped you take these pivotal decisions.**

**2. Assumably, first thing a B2C based founder does is that - sharing the amateur(beta) version of the product to
friends, and family and ask for their suggestions, Is this a good way because this set of users don't give us the
straightforward reviews? how did you manage to get product market fit for "Kabam"?**

**(Funny thing is my mom\[traditional South Indian\] understood the business, she is playing with the app and literally
is doing the marketing for me which I did not realize until a few days back - she calls up her friends and ask them to
try out the Android version).**

1.  I think the way we executed it, we sent an unsolicited email so many employees were confused and hesitant to use it.
    Many companies thought we were not trustworthy. Basically no one was using us, so that is why we pivoted. When we
    pivoted we learned it was really hard to build a platform and for us that meant we could not get users to come to
    us, so we learned - go where the users are. We were incredibly lucky as Facebook had just launched their platform
    and they were growing like gangbusters.
    
    Product-wise we learned a couple of things:  
    a) We did not hit people's passion points. People were not searching for stuff about work outside of work. Therefore
    we couldn't ride off of any free traffic from Google by people searching for our stuff  
    b) We needed to provide value within an ecosystem we could play in. This meant instead of going after enterprises
    (we didn't know inside the company their rules), we could create fan communities around TV and help TV show creators
    get to know their audiences more.

2.  Yes find the customers and watch them use it. IT's more important to watch them use it than to have them give you
    feedback. You certainly should ask for feedback, but in B2C, what and why they say it is worthless compared to what
    they do. I feel like in user testing which we did, it is there to look for patterns. But most people cannot tell you
    if they will use it or buy it = they may say it and not do it.

When asking users questions, ask them about the last time they used a product like yours, ask them to show you how they
found it it, what they did, etc... Easier for users to be telling a recount than what they WOULD do.

**1) At a high-level, how did you approach game design when leveraging others IP vs. creating your own?**

**2) Did you typically use multiple structures for agreements? Were the majority of rev-share based with some level of a
guarantee? What were the core variables that you found really important to discuss on both sides to have deals that
ended up with both parties happy?**

1.  In leveraging someone else's IP you have to be true to that story and things in that world. In many ways for us it
    de-risked execution because we did not need to invent new characters or story line. Therefore game design for us
    focused heavier on systems design, progression and level ups. In creating our own we needed to think about story
    line and environment more in addition to systems design.

2.  By the time we worked with IP at Kabam we were a larger size. There were definitely rev-share with a minimum of
    guarantees. Anytime there is attribution of traffic to figure out rev=share that should be clearly spelled out how
    it's done. Also you should talk about marketing plans of supporting one another pre-through launch. It is good to
    stick a person to help manage this integration and ask for support on their end. Also make sure you know what the
    rights are for. A lot of IP licensing is sliced and diced on platforms and geographies. Make sure you know what you
    are getting.

**I've a few questions about the early days of Kabam.**

**1.) How did Kabam, in general, choose what games to make?**

**2.) What was the first game?**

**3.) How did you decide on the idea to build Kingdoms of Camelot?**

1.  Our CEO really liked games, almost all kinds - MMO, RPG, FPS, and strategy/ city builder games. At the time Facebook
    only had the clicking games from Zynga and the one that made the most sense to build was a strategy/city building
    game. It was within our capabilities and really put a graphical interface to some of those text-based Facebook Games
    (remember Mafia Wars?)

2.  The first game was Kingdoms of Camelot on Facebook

3.  We chose Camelot as a theme because it was in the public domain, accessible and fun rich deep theme.

**I am a cofounder on an educational game company targeting adult learners (you may read Anthony's question, too).**

**My question is evolving around how you think it is possible for game based startups to get an MVP for investors out
the door, in a decent amount of time and with an acceptable quality. For me this seems way harder to pitch to investors
as one has to fight the aspect of doing a game (some investors already see this as less serious than web services) at
the same time as fighting the effect that people focus way more on graphics in a game than on its functionality
(compared to websites). Using game engines and assets already helps a lot, but it still seems that games make it hard to
match the growth rates and development times expected by startup investors. Can you provide insides on how to solve this
problem? :)**

This is a hard problem. In general investors shy away from investing in games not because it's "less serious" but
because it is "hits driven" and it's content. So just because you make one game, it is unclear if you can make another
game that is as big of a hit - in other words it is not as repeatable. Where this is different is when you have a
fundamental shift in the platform, and technology or even business model to show that the games are not just one hit. A
great example is the free to play model or really the IAP (in-app purchase) model. That business model was very new to
the gaming world as before it was just console games (you pay up front, no more and no less) .

Other ways to de-risk it for investors is to run a crowdfunding campaign and show that there are players or capital
lining up for this game. You can do this at [www.fig.co](http://www.fig.co)

Or you can go to a gaming platform like roblox try to start it. If you are in a country that gives gaming grants like
Australia. That is another option.

If you have a good gaming pedigree, you can look on Angellist and find some founders of gaming companies that angel
invest.

**1. Futuristic - where gaming and gamification will be 10-15 years time and how it will impact our societies and
industries - please use your boldest predictions?**

**2. Any thoughts how legal industry may use, learn from or benefit from gaming industry (or gamification)?**

**3. What are the key learnings/advices that you can share from your role of Head of Worldwide People and Culture
function? Any surprising ones?**

1.  My thoughts are not as grand - I think voice is going to be a large immersive seamless platform. Platform is still
    incredibly nascent.

2.  Move off of Word Perfect\! My feeling is that the legal industry is one of the slowest to adopt new technologies.
    This is because they bill by the hour. Anything that reduces their time means less profits. I think there are other
    things that need to be fixed first in order to start changing. The one thing the industry can learn from gaming is
    to align incentives with its end goal. It doesn't seem to be the case right now.

3.  Key Learnings - people will surprise you\! Good and bad. I feel like HR is one of the most under appreciated
    professions. They are like the complaint desk for the company. And, therefore can not attract as high of a caliber
    it can. It is changing a lot as more founders are moving into the company building phase. Companies that do it right
    have a great free system and people infrastructure to move the company in the direction it is needed. And give your
    HR person a hug today :)

How can you gamify things like elearning platforms i.e. leaderboards, quizzes etc.

I feel like for non-games you have to be true to your core loop of behavior. If you don't have a core behavior, then you
should ask yourself what is that behavior and build around it. Gamifying can help reinforce it.

**I know that one of the things that I really need for our team is a strong game designer. How would you go about
finding one in the Bay area (I'm in Mountain View) and what qualities and questions should I be asking them?**

1.  What kind of game are you making? Game designers come in all forms: map design, level design, systems design. You
    will likely need to be more specific. It is okay if you don't get the terminology write, just plainly write "what
    you will do" in bullet points on the job req.

2.  Assuming you do not have a lot of capital, If you have a solid team, then you'll be able to attract a solid game
    designer. If not, likely you can attract an inexperienced one. If you have traction, you can also attract a solid
    game designer. Without these it is cash or equity. This is the beginning of what you will need to do for the rest of
    the life of the company - recruit.

**How much weight do you give to a top-down analysis (e.g., platform, category, etc.) versus a bottom-up analysis (e.g.,
core loop, innovative mechanics) when selecting a new game development project?**

I weigh top down analysis much more - platform and category. Sam talks about how you cannot create technological waves,
but you can certainly ride the wave. This has been our experience at Kabam from a user point of view as well as a
fundraising perspective. It was so much easier for us to fundraise when the gaming industry was doing well, irrespective
of our performance. When facebook or mobile were growing so were our games.

**Parts of our product has some gamification factor in it, particularly a reputation system that incentivizes people to
engage and contribute quality answers to a question (symbolizing credibility).**

**1. I was wondering if you had any tips/resources for going about designing a reputation system?**

**2. We would like to test our MVP soon and was wondering what the process of getting and growing initial testers was
like in your experience?**

1.  I'm not sure off the top of head about designing a reputation system. However, here are a couple of tips when we
    were designing our communities:  
    a. Find elements in the badge that show trust. Usually the basic thing is tenure. Oftentimes you will see "Member
    since" , so you can see how veteran the person is and vet their answers accordingly  
    b. Two sided reviews. The underclassmen should be able to rate the upperclassman and vice versa. I think uber and
    Lyft do this well. This creates trust on both sides and helps keep people honest.  
    c. Rating . A rating will flow from quantity and quality. There may be more elements, but those are off the top of
    my list. If you are creating a community, you will need to think about roles and moderation and what they can do.

2.  If you can get a couple of folks within a school some underclassmen and some upperclassmen that would be the best.
    If you are close to a school you can advertise there, or you can post in a Facebook group. I would recruit a couple
    from each group and have them use your product. Ask them questions and watch what they do.
    
    Once you have your product ready, you should consider the platforms of where students hang out and go advertise
    there. I'm not sure if you are targeting high school or college or some other level of schooling or even country, so
    a little general on some of the sources.

**1) At a high-level, how did you approach game design when leveraging others IP vs. creating your own?**

**2) Did you typically use multiple structures for agreements? Were the majority of rev-share based with some level of a
guarantee? What were the core variables that you found really important to discuss on both sides to have deals that
ended up with both parties happy?**

1.  In leveraging someone else's IP you have to be true to that story and things in that world. In many ways for us it
    de-risked execution because we did not need to invent new characters or story line. Therefore game design for us
    focused heavier on systems design, progression and level ups. In creating our own we needed to think about story
    line and environment more in addition to systems design.

2.  By the time we worked with IP at Kabam we were a larger size. There were definitely rev-share with a minimum of
    guarantees. Anytime there is attribution of traffic to figure out rev=share that should be clearly spelled out how
    it's done. Also you should talk about marketing plans of supporting one another pre-through launch. It is good to
    stick a person to help manage this integration and ask for support on their end. Also make sure you know what the
    rights are for. A lot of IP licensing is sliced and diced on platforms and geographies. Make sure you know what you
    are getting.

career: founder, executive, and employee. I‚Äôm leaving out investor because the best path to being an investor that I‚Äôve
seen starts with being successful (or failing) at one of these three first.

Below I‚Äôll outline what I see as the pros/cons and useful strategies for each role.

I wrote this post though because when I talk to people about their careers I‚Äôm surprised at how often they focus on only
one of these paths without taking the time to consider other options. Often when they get advice, people tell them to
follow the path that they followed (as a YC partner and former founder, I‚Äôm very guilty of this).

I don‚Äôt attach value judgements to these three paths. In my ten years in The Bay Area I‚Äôve seen friends lead successful
and fulfilled lives following all three.

-----

## Founder

**Pro**  
‚Ä¢ Work on something you‚Äôre passionate about  
‚Ä¢ Bring something new into the world  
‚Ä¢ High level of responsibility often inspires extreme productivity  
‚Ä¢ Choose the people you work with  
‚Ä¢ Learn new skills at an extremely fast pace

**Con**  
‚Ä¢ Incredibly stressful. Even success hurts  
‚Ä¢ Probably won‚Äôt maximize your personal earnings  
‚Ä¢ significant financial/skillset/location hurdles to get started  
‚Ä¢ Large scale success often requires decade plus commitment  
‚Ä¢ Commitment level can significantly hurt personal relationships

**Strategy for People Who Want to be Founders**  
Your initial goal is to accumulate the prerequisites to being a founder.

**1.** Identify potential teammates you can work with who have the required technical skills to help you build your
MVP.  
**2.** Figure out the financial plan. I.e. Do you have enough money in savings, do you have friends/family who can
provide seed investment, can you bootstrap, can you reduce your spending and save enough give yourself 6-12 months to
work on your idea?  
**3.** Identify a problem that you and your potential teammates are passionate about solving.  
**4.** The least important (but still required) is having an idea on how of how to solve the problem.

Many people who want to be founders have one or more of these prerequisites missing. A popular mistake is trying to
hustle *around* a missing prerequisite instead of *solving the underlying issue*. If your team doesn‚Äôt have the
technical skills to build your MVP, don‚Äôt work with a dev shop. Make friends with people who do have these skills.
Convince them to join you.

Often times there are hard barriers preventing people from starting a company. In these cases my best advice is to move
to a tech hub (preferably the Bay Area) and work for a tech company until you can save the money, make friends with the
right potential teammates, or discover the problem that you are passionate about. It usually takes at least 10 years to
build a large and impactful company. It‚Äôs fine to delay your start date in order to give yourself the best chance of
success.

Notice that one of the prerequisites isn‚Äôt experience. Experience is over-valued (not completely unimportant - but
massively over-valued) by people who are thinking about starting a company. In almost all cases, no matter what
knowledge you bring to the table, you will learn most of what you need to know about your problem, your customer, and
the best solution after you start your company.

## Executive (Senior Manager at a Large Company)

**Pro**  
‚Ä¢ Stable income/benefits/etc.  
‚Ä¢ High level of prestige (only very successful founders have more prestige)  
‚Ä¢ A higher likelihood of having a huge impact (given that most startups fail).  
‚Ä¢ Doesn‚Äôt require building a team and acquiring money to get started

**Con**  
‚Ä¢ Producing results isn't necessarily how you move up the corporate ladder. Internal politics are usually as important,
if not more so.  
‚Ä¢ Success can be hampered or even prevented by others inside of your organization  
‚Ä¢ Requires the ability to pick companies that will be growing and successful for a long time  
‚Ä¢ Takes a long time to get a significant amount of responsibility

**Strategies for People Who Want to be Executives**  
I actually see two strategies within this path.

The first strategy is to pick a company that is growing quickly. If you do manage to pick a company like this early,
then you‚Äôll get more responsibility as the company grows - I also assume you are a friendly and productive team player.
For example, if you were one of the first 100 people at Facebook and you stayed there for ten years, you would have many
opportunities to become an executive. The hard part here is that picking a company that will grow rapidly for many years
is extremely difficult (in many ways your task is similar to a VC).

The other path is to go to work for a more established company. The people I‚Äôve seen do this effectively don‚Äôt think
about working their way up within one company alone. They often think about moving diagonally up between a set of
established name brand companies until they eventually land in an executive role. For example, you start out of college
at Google, get hired at Dropbox as a team lead, move to Yahoo to become a director, move back to Google - so on and so
forth.

People on the executive path either have to think like VCs and pick a company that is going to be one of the winners
over the next 10 years, or have their head on a swivel to constantly look for better and better opportunities both
inside and outside of their current company.

## Employee (individual contributor / middle manager)

**Pro**  
‚Ä¢ Stable income/benefits/etc.  
‚Ä¢ More work and fewer meetings  
‚Ä¢ More often directly affecting the customer through your work  
‚Ä¢ With a high demand skill-set you have flexibility in where/how much you work  
‚Ä¢ Often have more time to spend with friends and family

**Con**  
‚Ä¢ Productivity can be blocked by bad management  
‚Ä¢ You often don‚Äôt have control what you work on  
‚Ä¢ Often don‚Äôt get a voice in major decisions - even when you ‚Äúknow the right answer‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs harder to become very wealthy  
‚Ä¢ It can be boring  
‚Ä¢ If you don‚Äôt maintain a high demand skillset or your productivity drops it‚Äôs easier to be fired

**Strategies for People Who Want to be Employees**  
Your strategy for picking a place to work is similar to an exec‚Äôs. You either need to spot and join a quickly growing
company or find a way into a well known successful company. It‚Äôs much easier to go between brand name companies when you
start with a brand name company. Also, in my experience, it‚Äôs much easier to optimize this path as a software developer.

-----

The last thing I‚Äôll say is it takes time to be good at each role. When you‚Äôre in college there is this idea that you
should take your 20s to discover yourself and the find the work that is most enjoyable to you. The problem is that if it
takes 5-10 years to truly get good at something and you spend 10 years discovering what you want to get good at‚Ä¶it‚Äôs
going to take a long time for you to feel like a highly skilled productive person (and to recieve the rewards that come
with this). It‚Äôs not that you shouldn‚Äôt explore, it‚Äôs that you need to understand the costs of that exploration and plan
accordingly.

**Using Machine and Deep Learning to Create and Serve Content, China‚Äôs Toutiao Created a Product with Engagement Similar
to that of Social Networks - All without a Social Graph**

Toutiao, one of the flagship products of Bytedance\*, may be the largest app you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äìit‚Äôs like every news
feed you read, YouTube, and TechMeme in one. Over 120M people in China use it each day. Yet what‚Äôs most interesting
about Toutiao isn‚Äôt that people consume such varied content all in one place‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs *how* Toutiao serves it up. Without
any explicit user inputs, social graph, or product purchase history to rely on, Toutiao offers a personalized, high
quality-content feed for each user that is powered by machine and deep learning algorithms.

Going a step further than merely serving up content, Toutiao‚Äôs algorithms also create content: During the 2016 Olympics,
a Toutiao bot wrote original news coverage, publishing stories on major events more quickly than traditional media
outlets. The bot-written articles enjoyed read rates (\# of reads and \# of impressions) in line with those produced at
a slower speed and higher cost by human writers on average.

The average user spends more than *74 minutes* each day in Toutiao -- that‚Äôs more than the average user spends on
Facebook<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>, and more than twice what they spend on
Snapchat<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>. More than half that time is spent watching short-form
videos; this coupled with over 10 billion video views per day makes Toutiao the YouTube of China (along with, of course,
everything else it offers).

How did Toutiao do this? Especially without massive consumer platforms at scale like those orchestrated by Chinese
conglomerates Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent? In this post I‚Äôll explore how Toutiao got to 120M daily active users. Toutiao
doesn‚Äôt attribute its growth to any one factor, but rather to the interplay between many tactical and strategic
decisions it made starting at launch; specifically, five key advantages, all of which I have outlined below. And while
‚Äúsuper apps‚Äù aren‚Äôt as common in the U.S., I believe there are specific lessons in this case that can inspire others
in building their own products and platforms.

**But first, a bit of background**

Toutiao launched in 2012. The app uses machine and deep learning algorithms to source and surface content that users
will find most interesting. Toutiao‚Äôs underlying technology learns about readers through their usage ‚Äì taps, swipes,
time spent on each article, time of the day the user reads, pauses, comments, interactions with the content and location
‚Äì but doesn‚Äôt require any explicit input from the user and is not built on their social graph. Today, each user is
measured across millions of dimensions and the result is a personalized, extensive, and high-quality content feed for
every user, each time they open the app.

# The Five Hidden Forces Behind Toutiao

## 1: Mind the gap, seize the opportunity

While timing is everything for a startup, it takes deliberate effort to build an addictive app. Toutiao‚Äôs timing was
fortuitous, but its exploitation of this unique moment was deliberate. Toutiao launched as smartphone use was taking off
in China: mobile penetration increased from nearly nothing in 2010 to 65%
by 2014<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>. Moreover, many of the largest content providers had not
yet developed mobile apps or mobile-friendly sites, meaning that true mobile-optimized information and entertainment was
rare. By mid-2012, there were only six significant news apps on the Chinese Android platform. Four of them were direct
extensions of existing news portals with limited mobile optimization, and the other two were aggregators that relied
exclusively on slow and impersonal editor input to determine what stories to show. Further, the Chinese audience's
demand for content (both articles and videos) was underserved by Chinese social networks such as WeChat and Weibo.
WeChat launched as a messenger and to this day has a closed social network (i.e. sharing/moments are private to friends
only).

Toutiao stepped into this gap with an easy-to-use, personalized, informative, and addictive mobile-first app. From the
outset, Toutiao was extremely easy to start using ‚Äì all it took was a download. There was no need to create an account
and password, to link it to social media (unless the user so desired), or to provide information on interests or
preferences. The app‚Äôs simple design also made it intuitive to use with no prior knowledge or tutorials. For any app,
driving initial engagement ‚Äì moving from downloads to DAUs ‚Äì is notoriously difficult. It‚Äôs typical to lose users at
every step of the process due to discouragement, confusion, or annoyance.

The name of the app Jinri Toutiao (meaning ‚Äútoday‚Äôs headlines‚Äù in Chinese) and the icon of the app were catchy for
users, resulting in excellent user growth. It was also the first time various news articles were aggregated in one
place. From the very early days, Toutiao tracked information about each user - their taps, swipes, time spent per
article and location to power the recommendation engine which we will discuss later in the post. One month after launch,
Toutiao became a personalized news aggregator for several of its users. The product, the only one of its kind and
delicately designed at that time, led to a rapid growth. They hit 1M DAUs only four months after launch. Toutiao gave
new internet users something to ‚Äúdo‚Äù when their mobile time was still up for grabs. Toutiao updated the app almost
weekly throughout its first year, as it consistently innovated, iterated, and improved its features and algorithms, and
this resulted in improved retention over time.

In the years that followed, competition for user share of attention on mobile would drastically increase ‚Äì the number of
mobile apps available in China more than tripled in the three years from 2012
to 2015<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>. But Toutiao‚Äôs early lead meant that, by the time
competitors arrived, it already had an important and valuable foothold.

*The image below shows the personalized feed of two different users.*

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-2-1.png" alt="Toutiao 2-1" width="2397" height="1729" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101016" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-2-1.png)

## 2: A data network effect deliberately built across the entire system

You can have all the algorithms in the world, but without an addictive product there is no data, and without data, no
algorithm can make the system better. Matt Turck has written about the power of the data network
[here](http://mattturck.com/the-power-of-data-network-effects/). Simply put, the more users use your product, the more
data they contribute. The more data they contribute, the smarter your product becomes. The smarter your product is
(e.g., better personalization, recommendations), the better it serves your users and they are more likely to come back
often and contribute more data ‚Äî thus creating a virtuous cycle.

By building an addictive product, Toutiao generates engagement data from their users. That data is fed into Toutiao‚Äôs
algorithms, which in turn further refines the products‚Äô quality. Ultimately, the company plans to use this virtuous
cycle to optimize every stage of what they call the ‚Äúcontent lifecycle‚Äù: Creation, Curation, Recommendation and
Interaction.

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-3-1.jpg" alt="Toutiao 3-1" width="4000" height="2250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101018" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-3-1.jpg)

**Creation**  
Ever since the invention of written language, content creation has been the exclusive domain of humans. Toutiao looks to
change that. It‚Äôs begun with Xiaomingbot, an artificial intelligence that has already published more than 8,000 stories
on the platform to-date. It debuted during the Olympics in 2016, where it published stories on major events more quickly
(approximately 2 seconds after the event ended) than traditional media outlets. Indeed, the bot-authored articles
enjoyed read rates (\# of reads and \# of impressions) in-line with those produced at a slower speed and higher cost by
human writers on average.

*Below is a screenshot of an article written by the Xiaomingbot describing the results of the tennis match between Andy
Murray and Juan Martin Del Potro during the 2016 Olympics.*

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-4.jpeg" alt="Toutiao 4" width="750" height="1334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101006" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-4.jpeg)

To achieve this, Toutiao had to overcome a couple of significant technical challenges:

First, writing stories on Olympic game results required data, and Toutiao pulled it from three sources: \[a\] real time
score updates from the Olympics organization, \[b\] images from an image-gathering-company it had recently acquired to
find relevant visual media, and \[c\] monitoring live text commentary about the game. It also started with four sports ‚Äî
Table Tennis, Tennis, Badminton and Women‚Äôs Soccer ‚Äî that were easier to recap from a technical standpoint (Table
Tennis, Tennis and Badminton are ‚Äúturn-based‚Äù games and the rules of the games are simpler vs. other sports. Unique
access to a high-quality data source for Women‚Äôs Soccer made that the fourth game covered.)

Second, Toutiao had to figure out how to combine data from these three sources to ensure an internally consistent and
relevant story. This was a much larger challenge than even accessing and interpreting the data in the first place. Any
selected image needed to be relevant to the results of the event, and also appropriate for the takeaways from the
commentary. This, in turn, required Toutiao‚Äôs AI team to integrate natural language processing capabilities with
contextual image recognition. They ended up with a combination of a grammar-based representation for generating story
templates, a ranking algorithm to select relevant sentences from live text commentary, and an image-text matching
algorithm to tie it all together. The system also employs convolutional neural networks to analyze content in candidate
images. By training on historical data, the model is able to pick the most relevant and visually appealing image for the
story. They also use sequence-to-sequence deep learning algorithms to summarize existing stories into daily highlights
and suggest better titles for articles.The system employs recurrent neural networks to compute vector representation for
sentences and these sentence vectors are further fed into a ranking model to pick concise summaries for each article.

The products of these efforts ‚Äì 450 published stories with 500-1,000 words during the Rio Olympics ‚Äì that were hugely
successful. They enjoyed read rates (\# of reads divided by \# of impressions) on par with those produced at a slower
speed and higher cost by human writers. Toutiao has extended this capability beyond sports to over 8,000 stories
to-date, and is working hard to close some of the remaining technical loopholes that make human writers recognizable.

**Curation**  
A major engagement driver for Toutiao in its early days was ‚Äúsoft news‚Äù‚Äì areas like celebrity gossip, pop culture and
lifestyle articles. This was no accident. Contrary to official news, which was distributed by well-known state-owned
news sources, soft content was distributed across the internet on a plethora of individual sites. In short, there was no
central place to access the content: users who were looking for it would have to invest meaningful time in visiting
different sites, and had no assurance they were getting the most interesting information. Toutiao changed that. In
owning, centralizing, and optimizing the distribution, it reduced the time a user needed to find content to nearly zero,
and it increased their confidence that they were reading the most interesting stories. This created real value for
users.

At its core, content curation is a two-sided problem: the curator must find content, in addition to serving it to its
users. The first requires visiting websites, identifying stories, and collecting relevant metadata. The second requires
continuously updating a central repository of stories, and creating as many personalized versions as possible. Both are
process-intensive tasks where algorithms have a distinct advantage over humans. Toutiao‚Äôs only meaningful competition in
this space when it launched were web portals where human editors handled this work, and Toutiao‚Äôs use of algorithms gave
it a major advantage over the manual competition.

The speed with which the system could do what took human editors much longer translated directly into value for
Toutiao‚Äôs users. Toutiao could gather more content more quickly and at a lower cost, creating a major advantage in a
business were customer value is directly tied to content quality, relevance and refresh rate. The use of algorithms also
meant that each user could have their own, interest based and continuously updated profile ‚Äì something that no human
editor would ever have the time to do.

Toutiao also uses algorithms to identify and filter out low-quality content. A content distribution platform is only as
good as the content it distributes. The days of mass-distributed cookie-cutter content (e.g., newspapers, magazines) are
over. In Toutiao‚Äôs world, the distribution platform only serves what is interesting to its users. False reporting and
spam are major issues in the media industry. Toutiao‚Äôs underlying technology uses a text classification algorithm to
determine if an article is fake news, uses clickbait titles, or doesn‚Äôt meet Toutiao‚Äôs quality standards. Here, Toutiao
also leans on user moderators to flag fake articles and employs human moderators to arbitrate on disputed reporting.

**Recommendation**  
Content recommendation is the feature for which Toutiao is best-known, and to which it owes much of its success and
reputation. The use of machine and deep learning algorithms at this stage of the content lifecycle is what has sets
Toutiao apart from its peers, and is key to driving continued user growth and retention.

The question that the recommendation engine is trying to solve is simple: **what are the one hundred articles the
platform can recommend to each user that are most likely to result in continued engagement?** This is a question with
major consequences ‚Äì the AI team has recognized that 100 headlines is a retention ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù (users that do not retain
long-term tend to drop off dramatically after seeing \~100 headlines, similar to Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äú10 friends‚Äù rule). It is
also a question that humans are unsuited to answer: no human editor could ever regularly and quickly identify the
optimal set of headlines for every one of the app‚Äôs new users.

As simple as the question may be, the solution is complex. For every new user, Toutiao blends signals from three key
areas to create a feed that it hopes is engaging and will push users over the 100-headline threshold:

  - User profiles: are initially built based on the app‚Äôs understanding of the user‚Äôs demographics (their age, location,
    gender, and socio-economic status)
  - Content: to understand the content of articles, Toutiao turns to natural language processing to determine if the
    article is trending, whether it is long or short, and the timeliness of the article (some articles are evergreen
    while others have a very short half-life)
  - Context: pertain to location-related data (localities like geography, weather, local news, etc.)

The underlying algorithms must then identify the strongest statistical match between the user‚Äôs profile, its own content
profile, and context, and it must do this on a continual basis. This matching is meant to optimize the percent of
articles a user reads (clicks on) and the percent of articles that a user finishes (measured by the time spent on the
page). When a user first opens the app, the system uses the basic data in the profile for the matching: a user in
Silicon Valley, for example, may be more likely to click on articles about tech. The system also makes sure to show a
variety of articles to assess interest/disinterest‚Äì in doing so, can help users discover previously unknown content and
test their potential interests. Over time, as the app collects user information, these recommendations get further and
further refined. The engine learns quickly ‚Äì for most users, it takes less than one day to successfully learn their
interests (indicated by 80% read rates). The result is the case of strong user retention (\>45%) that is similar to
social networks and one of the largest time spent per user apps in the world.

**Interaction**  
As Toutiao has grown, interaction on the platform has become more and more central to its user value proposition. Rather
than leaving it to the users to find each other, Toutiao uses underlying algorithms to help enable meaningful
connections. Nowhere is this more relevant than in its recently developed question-and-answer feature, where the AI team
was tasked with developing a matching engine that links a question-asker with someone who can answer them. Toutiao
recently published a [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1076) for the ACL conference touting these results. Their
proposed ‚ÄúConditional Focused Neural Question Answering with Large-Scale Knowledge Bases approach‚Äù achieves an accuracy
of 75.7% on a data set of 108K questions, and outperforms the current state of the art (better than the Memory Network
and LTG-CNN methods on the benchmark dataset) by an 11.8% margin.

Toutiao‚Äôs underlying technology not only creates a better user experience, but also serves to strengthen the company‚Äôs
competitive moat. More compelling content and interactions meant users would spend more time on the platform, and the
more time they spent on the platform the better the use of algorithms became. The smarter the system is, the better it
can distribute content ‚Äì and the more content creators it attracts. This, in turn, drives more users to the platform.
And thus is born a strong data network effect - the power of the system grows exponentially with the scale of the
system. There are competitors who have launched since then (especially after seeing Toutiao‚Äôs success), however it has
been difficult to match the accuracy and efficacy of the Toutiao recommendation engine leading to continued rapid growth
for Toutiao.

## 3\. From content aggregation to content destination

It is not uncommon to see apps strive to move from content aggregation to content destination. However it is extremely
challenging from a brand and creative strategy to make that happen. Here is how Toutiao did it. Toutiao offered two
significant benefits to content contributors over the platforms.

**Strong incentives via revenue sharing** that enabled writers to make money from very early on. In 2014, Toutiao rolled
out incentive programs to attract more content creators to the platform. These ranged from offering office space, tools,
minimum guarantees per month if they hit certain key milestones (e.g., \# of articles, read rates) to sharing revenue
via monetization. Toutiao began monetizing via ads since 2014 and this enabled revenue sharing opportunities with their
content contributors.

This was the function that launched Toutiao, but as it has grown, Toutiao has transitioned into a deeper platform for
content generation, consumption, and connections. Today, it hosts more than 800,000 Toutiaohao accounts ‚Äì professional
media outlets, bloggers, and influencers who use the platform to share articles, images, and videos with Toutiao users .
It hosts many more users sharing short posts through Wei Toutiao. The result is the wide variety of content that Toutiao
hosts today ranging from news to stocks to science to relationships. Top 20 categories account for only 60% of the
content supply and no single category contributes over 10% of the content.

Below is an example of a variety of content that a user can choose from (the screenshot only displays the 40 of the 50+
channels users can choose from):

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-5-1.png" alt="Toutiao 5-1" width="1481" height="1400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101020" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-5-1.png)

**Larger and more relevant audience** than other platforms that directly translated to increasing brand presence for
content contributors. Almost all contributors create and distribute content on all platforms. But for many contributors,
they have the ability to attract more traffic from Toutiao due to the strong recommendation engine. One example is "
Ê¨¢Â≠êtv‚Äú ( Huanzi TV). This creator creates short videos about folks' lives and customs in the countryside of China.
Each of his videos has an average of 700,000 views, while the views in his Wechat official account is less than 1/40 of
that on Toutiao. Toutiao has enabled the long tail of contributors to reach their most relevant audience more seamlessly
than any other platform in China.

## 4\. Unencumbered by formats

Instead of being stubborn about their core format (e.g., listicles, long form content and news), Toutiao was quick to
expand to other formats when the data suggested they should. In 2015, at the time where most video platforms in China
are focusing on long-form videos, Toutiao added video capability and started to support PGC short video content
(typically 1-5 mins) on its platform. Toutiao had observed an increase in supply of video content in 2014 as
connectivity and infrastructure had improved significantly by 2014. Additionally, Toutiao rolled out several incentive
programs to promote video content creation on its platform. The transition from text to image to video was similar to
what most US platforms have seen to date.

Later in March 2016, Toutiao launched Toutiao Video (which is now renamed to Watermelon Video), a separate PGC short
video app powered by the same algorithm engine as Toutiao. Similar to written content, the underlying algorithms
recommend the most relevant videos to users based on their interest graph. Toutiao is now the "go-to platform" for PGC
short video content. More than half of its 74 mins daily usage for each user is spent watching short-form videos and
Toutiao is close to exceeding 10 billion video views every day.

## 5\. Early monetization and alignment with product

Toutiao has reached unprecedented scale in revenue in a short time frame (5 years since launch and 3 years since they
began monetizing) and it is remarkable that they are doing it without leveraging any social graph or product purchase
history. Toutiao is on target to hit more than 15B RMB (\>$2.2B USD) in revenue this year - one of the fastest growing
apps in terms of revenue in the history of the internet.

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Toutiao-Blog-Post-Graphics_revenue.png" alt="Toutiao Revenue Growth" width="1569" height="1898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101028" />

Of the many things that Toutiao does, one element that is core to its model more than any other: it is good at
identifying what its users want to see. It is fitting, then, that its business model maps perfectly to that strength.
Toutiao generates revenue by matching relevant ads to users, using the same proprietary technology behind their content
targeting. This has three important benefits:

First, it reduced the impact of monetization on the user experience ‚Äì and may have actually improved the experience\!
Users typically consider ads as intrusive and degrading to their experience, but ads aligned with user preferences are
less so. In serving ads that are highly relevant to a user‚Äôs interests, Toutiao in many ways acts as a product discovery
mechanism.

The second is that it increased the rates that Toutiao could charge advertisers. One of the key problems in advertising
is identifying how to selectively place your ads in front of the highest potential customers, and advertisers spend
countless hours and enormous sums of money trying to target effectively. Toutiao‚Äôs technology, which solves this
targeting problem natively, represented a solution and saves advertisers from paying a big premium for it.

Third, since the primary use case is to read and view content, users are more receptive to seeing relevant targeted ads
and therefore there is more inventory available to advertisers.

The combination of all these three factors results in much better CTRs (Click Through Rates) on Toutiao vs. competitors.
Third party survey data estimates Toutiao‚Äôs CTRs to be 200% better than its peers.

**Impact on the Future of Content Discovery**

Toutiao is chipping away at their end goal, which is essentially to wipe away the concept of search and just serve up
aggregated, hyper-relevant content. We‚Äôve seen ‚Äúcontent aggregators‚Äù come and go in the U.S. but it is possible that
they are an idea whose time is yet to come ‚Äì and that better algorithms will be the catalyst for success. Facebook and
Twitter are both critical sources for consumption of news in the U.S. today. The other giant in the room here is Google,
which in July announced that the feed in its mobile app would be increasing its use of machine learning to better show
their users the information they will find most relevant and interesting ‚Äì a feed that incorporates all types of news.

parts.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> You hope they are the parts for a spaceship, and they look
like they might be, but it‚Äôs impossible to tell when they‚Äôre all in a bag.

So you start figuring out how the parts fit together as you fall. Every once in a while, it turns out you do have the
parts for a spaceship‚Äîthe market is huge, you have a great product, there‚Äôs a natural monopoly, and you have a credible
path to be the winner. In that case, there‚Äôs plenty of advice available for you.

Much of the time, you don‚Äôt have the parts to make anything at all, and should just try to hit the ground as gently as
possible.

But a reasonable amount of the time, it turns out you have the parts for an airplane. An airplane is still a cool and
valuable thing to build, but if you try to fly an airplane to the moon you are going to be in a world of hurt. This is
true regardless of how well you build and fly that airplane.

In this case, you can figure out how to go get a new bag of parts (a new market, a new product, a very different
strategy, etc.), and keep trying to build a spaceship, or just decide to have a really good airplane. Some people are
willing to risk everything they‚Äôve built for the chance to go the moon, and again, there‚Äôs plenty of advice out there
for those people. But many rational people are happy with the airplane they‚Äôve built, and there‚Äôs not much advice about
what to do in this situation.

Let‚Äôs define a ‚Äúreally good airplane‚Äù as a company that has profitability within reach and is on track to be worth $100
million with several more years of hard work. This is nothing to be ashamed of‚Äîquite the opposite, obviously. This is a
triumph by almost any metric. This is what happens to most very lucky, very smart, very determined people who decide to
start a startup and have everything go their way except happening upon a perfect market.

The most important thing to understand is that this is where founders and investors often get misaligned. Many startup
investors are looking for spaceships‚Äìairplanes don‚Äôt matter much to them, though they matter quite a bit to the
founders. Your existing investors will usually be willing to take almost any amount of risk to see if you can somehow
turn an airplane into a spaceship (but often there‚Äôs not much more advice offered than ‚Äúpoint your plane at the moon,
burn more fuel, and let‚Äôs see what happens‚Äù).

Be frank and realistic with your existing investors; you will eventually persuade them that a small multiple is better
than a loss. The best investors understand how venture investing works and don‚Äôt fight over outcomes like this (in fact,
many of them will treat you extra-generously in the hopes of funding your next company). But as a general rule, the
longer you delude your investors here, the worse shape you‚Äôll be in.

The second most important thing to understand is that raising too much money or raising money at too high a valuation
can severely limit your optionality. Very often I‚Äôve seen cases where founders know in their hearts they have an
airplane but are able to convince good investors it might still be a spaceship. This really causes a lot of heartache,
and often precludes your opportunity for a good acquisition later.

The answer to this is simple in theory but the temptation is difficult to resist in practice. Don‚Äôt raise a lot of money
at a high price when you think the company is probably not going to increase another 10x in value and you‚Äôd be pretty
happy selling the company soon. It usually means that you have to change how you run the company, and it may mean that
you need to find a path to profitability with the money you currently have. But it‚Äôs far less painful to deal with this
now rather than putting the company in a position that will preclude the option you think is best.

Finally, you may want to begin to think about how to position the company for an eventual acquisition. Companies get
bought, not sold‚Äîit‚Äôs very difficult to force an acquisition to happen, and nearly impossible if you haven‚Äôt built
something legitimately valuable (somehow, this fact surprises founders who decide ‚Äòwe‚Äôd like to get acquired‚Äô almost
every time‚Ä¶). But beginning to develop relationships with potential acquirers is a good idea‚Äîit usually takes a long
time, and personal relationships usually help.

And remember that this is still an outcome to be very proud of. And if you want, you can always start another company.
Silicon Valley is filled with people who had one or several mid-success companies before eventually hitting it out of
the park.

[some](http://www.paulgraham.com/webstartups.html) [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/future.html) that predicted the
way startup fundraising would change in the next decade - accurately, it turns out. Paul Graham predicted that there
would be way more startups, that they‚Äôd be cheaper to start, that new kinds of investors would fund them, that founders
would be more technical, and that founders would keep control of their companies. All of those seem to have come true.

I've noticed that raising money for a biotech or other life
science<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> company in 2019 looks a lot like raising money for a tech
company 10 years ago. Since then, fundamental forces caused fundraising for tech companies to change dramatically. I see
those same forces that Paul Graham wrote about happening with biotech companies now. And I believe that they are going
to change biotech fundraising very much the way they changed tech company fundraising.

### How tech startup fundraising changed from 2005 to now

In 2005, when Y Combinator started, there was already a well developed ecosystem of venture capital firms in Silicon
Valley and Boston. But access to those venture capital firms was limited.

VCs preferred to fund companies that already seemed like a sure bet - in other words, were far along. They also
preferred to fund MBAs with previous executive experience and shied away from unproven teams with technical founders.
Because they had a lock on the funding market, they asked for onerous financial terms and often replaced founders with
favored executives. The only model of institutional seed funding was the ‚Äúbusiness incubator‚Äù model, where VC firms
would fund well-connected founders they knew and incubate them in their office.

Then, the cost to start a tech company plummeted. It plummeted because new infrastructure was created: a combination of
open source software, modern web frameworks, SaaS developer tools, cloud hosting, and better distribution channels. This
meant that a lot of technical founders, who couldn't raise money from VCs off a PowerPoint, were able to launch a
product and get users with minimal funding. Once they had proven that their idea had merit, they could use their
traction to raise funding.

Companies like this now only needed a small amount of money to get started, but there wasn‚Äôt any place to get it,
because institutional investors didn‚Äôt make small investments. This was the key insight that led to the creation of YC,
and also to the hundreds of institutional seed funds that sprung up to take advantage of the new opportunity. Easy
access to flexible, institutional seed funding led to an explosion of tech startups, and today this is the default path
for tech startups to get started.

Because these companies wouldn‚Äôt raise VC until they were much further along and had leverage, the balance of power
shifted. Founders increasingly retained control of their company. Investors lost the power to fire founders and bring in
favored executives. And when they did, they realized something surprising: despite their inexperience, the founders were
often the right people to run the company.<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

### What‚Äôs happening now with biotech companies

Today, early stage biotech funding is dominated by the ‚Äúventure creation model‚Äù. In the venture creation model, the VC
firm creates the company. They have an initial idea and put together a team of favored executives, often from their pool
of entrepreneurs-in-residence, to run it. The startup is typically incubated out of the VC‚Äôs offices. The VC invests a
large amount of money upfront and takes a controlling ownership stake.

Just as VC-incubated tech companies made sense when tech companies were expensive to start, this model made sense when
the cost to start a biotech company was high. Until recently, no one could get anything done before a VC wrote a $10M
check, so this was the only way to get started.

But that‚Äôs no longer the case. Just like new infrastructure brought down the cost to start a tech company, new
infrastructure has brought down the cost of doing biology dramatically. Today, founders can make real progress proving a
concept for a biotech company for much less, often as little as $100K. There are [low](http://wuxibiologics.com)
[cost](http://evotec.com) [CROs](http://chempartner.com) that will do scientific work for a fee. Companies like [Science
Exchange](https://www.scienceexchange.com/) make access to CROs and scientific supplies instantaneous and cost effective
to small companies. It‚Äôs easy to rent [fully equipped](https://mbcbiolabs.com/) [lab
space](http://www.berkeleybiolabs.com/) by the bench, and there are [companies](https://www.quartzy.com/) to help you
[stock it](https://www.happilabs.org/). Affordable lab robots from companies like [OpenTrons](https://opentrons.com/)
make it possible to automate batch experiments, and computational drug discovery from companies like
[Atomwise](https://www.atomwise.com/) allows some experiments to be done completely in silico. Companies like [Cognition
IP](https://www.cognitionip.com/) are bringing down the cost of filing patents, and companies like
[Enzyme](https://www.enzyme.com/) are streamlining FDA submission.

Because of this infrastructure, bio companies routinely clear major scientific hurdles during YC‚Äôs short program. Often
therapeutics companies are able to show that their concept is effective in animal models. Diagnostic companies can show
success with human samples. Synthetic biology companies successfully engineer cell lines.

I‚Äôll give a couple of examples from recent YC companies.

In 2015, Jose Mejia Oneto was an MD/PhD who left orthopaedic surgery residency to pursue an idea for a way to localize
the delivery of chemotherapy. When Jose applied to YC, he had developed the technique in academia but hadn't yet tried
applying it to therapeutics in animals. When he was admitted to YC, he founded [Shasqi](http://www.shasqi.com/). Using
just the funding from YC, he was able to show in less than three months in a breast cancer mouse model that his
localized delivery outperformed conventional chemo.

[Athelas](https://athelas.com/) makes a device that does at-home blood tests for oncology patients, using a new computer
vision based technique. The founders Tanay and Deepika started the company while still in college and were able to make
a working prototype with just $40K in investment. During YC they were able to run a 350 patient initial study that
showed very good results. Their device is now FDA cleared, and they‚Äôre serving thousands of
patients.<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>

Of course, running clinical trials for drugs remains very
expensive<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>, and biotech companies will ultimately need to raise
tons of money to deliver on their initial promise. But this is not too different from tech companies. The biggest YC
(software) companies have each raised over $1B. The important part is that these companies were able to *get started*
with less than $100K and to de-risk their idea enough to raise more money later.

### Predictions for the future

Because you can start cheaply, it‚Äôs now possible to start a biotech company the way people start a tech company. By
raising money incrementally, rather than a giant amount upfront, you can keep control of your company. And you can work
on your own idea, not just ideas that VCs come up with.

This new path has drawn a new kind of biotech founder. Many of the biotech founders we see at YC are grad students or
postdocs<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>. Previously their career options were to stay in academia
or to join a big pharma company. Starting their own company is now a viable third option.

If this plays out the way it did in 2005, we'll see an explosion in the funding options for biotech companies. Many
traditional biotech investors are still looking for the controlling legal terms that went out of vogue in tech in the
early 2000's. But just like what happened with tech investing, a new crop of biotech and tech/biotech crossover funds
have created a vibrant new bio seed investor ecosystem. As a result, YC bio companies now typically raise $1-5M seed
rounds after each batch.

Even more exciting, this would mean we're still at the beginning of an explosion in the number of biotech companies. And
more of these companies will look like tech companies: instead of being run by VCs and hired execs, they‚Äôll be run by
the founders who care about their ideas, and who will sustain that passion building companies they love and that change
the world for the better.

November 2012  
  
The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you
have yourself.  
  
The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that
they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook
all began this way.

### **Problems**

Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It
sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make
is to solve problems no one has.  
  
I made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn't want to be online. It's
not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this stupid idea? Because I didn't pay attention
to users. I invented a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that. I didn't notice my
model was wrong until I tried to convince users to pay for what we'd built. Even then I took embarrassingly long to
catch on. I was attached to my model of the world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to want it\!  
  
Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is
doubly dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you
into working on them.  
  
At YC we call these "made-up" or "sitcom" startup ideas. Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a
startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's
not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea
that sounded plausible, but was actually bad.  
  
For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often
they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely many of these people would like a site where
they could talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you
could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features. \[1\]  
  
The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don't say "I would *never* use
this." They say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when the startup launches, it will sound
plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other
people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. \[2\]

### **Well**

When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making ‚Äî not just people who
could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the
simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the
amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to
compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a
small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but
nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.  
  
Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making and whose y axis represents how
much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense
crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to
excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole
that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well.  
  
Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet
owners.  
  
Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. There were only
a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Thirty years later
Facebook had the same shape. Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few
thousand, but those few thousand users wanted it a lot.  
  
When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it
even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the
idea is probably bad. \[3\]  
  
You don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing
for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong
that it's a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.  
  
But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea, it's not a sufficient one.
If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a
good startup idea. Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of.
Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So you
spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting
them in.  
  
Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other machines; other languages besides Basic; operating
systems; applications; IPO.

### **Self**

How do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea? How do you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company,
or just a niche product? Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb didn't realize at first how big a market they were
tapping. Initially they had a much narrower idea. They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during
conventions. They didn't foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually. All they knew at
first is that they were onto something. That's probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.  
  
Occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche. And sometimes I can see a
path that's not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC. But there are limits to how well this can be
done, no matter how much experience you have. The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea
is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.  
  
So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is
disappointing but interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you're at the
leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to
be right.  
  
In *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, Robert Pirsig says:

> You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.

I've wondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting
specifically, but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of
person who has them.  
  
Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be
at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark
Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much. If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they'd like to publish
their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him
it seemed natural.  
  
Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field "live in the future." Combine that with
Pirsig and you get:

> Live in the future, then build what's missing.

That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor
Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed
a gap in the world.  
  
If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas, it's generally the result of some external stimulus
hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think "I bet we could write a Basic
interpreter for it." Drew Houston realizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks "I really need to make my files live
online." Lots of people heard about the Altair. Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders
to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.  
  
The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up" but "notice." At YC we call ideas that
grow naturally out of the founders' own experiences "organic" startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all
begin this way.  
  
That may not have been what you wanted to hear. You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and
instead I'm telling you that the key is to have a mind that's prepared in the right way. But disappointing though it may
be, this is the truth. And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a
weekend.  
  
If you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably
smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will
consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you're
also looking for a cofounder. \[4\]  
  
You don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast. Other domains change
fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put
it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run.  
  
Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them. That's not absolutely
necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn't) but it's an advantage. It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like
putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can think instead
"That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight." It's even better when you're both a
programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen
inside one head.

### **Noticing**

Once you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be
missing. If you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously
missing. What won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don't merely turn on
the filter "What's missing?" Also turn off every other filter, particularly "Could this be a big company?" There's
plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you're thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of
good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.  
  
Most things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around
you.  
  
But you *know* the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It's
impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to
build things in the next few years that will make you think "What did I do before x?"  
  
And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn
off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the
world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn't get from your bed to the front
door if you stopped to question everything.  
  
But if you're looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted
and start to question things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it's hard to get
email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email?
Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around
after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?  
  
Pay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that
it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable. If you knew about all the things
we'll get in the next 50 years but don't have yet, you'd find present day life pretty constraining, just as someone from
the present would if they were sent back 50 years in a time machine. When something annoys you, it could be because
you're living in the future.  
  
When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as *obvious*, at least to you. When
we started Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers making individual HTML pages. It was
obvious to us as programmers that these sites would have to be generated by software. \[5\]  
  
Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how
weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn't seen.  
  
Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may be best not to make too much of a direct frontal
attack on the problem ‚Äî i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas. The best plan may be just to keep a background
process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have
a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies. \[6\]  
  
Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you
have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it. If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained
themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month before the Altair appeared? They
probably would have worked on a less promising idea. Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox: an
SAT prep startup. But Dropbox was a much better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his skills.
\[7\]  
  
A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that,
you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already
existed.  
  
Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as "toys"
often produces good ones. When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being
important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something
cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft
started working on them. I'm old enough to remember that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers
was "hobbyists." BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project. The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to
stalk one another.  
  
At YC we're excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as
toys. To us that's positive evidence an idea is good.  
  
If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford not to), you can turn "Live in the future and build
what's missing" into something even better:

> Live in the future and build what seems interesting.

### **School**

That's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about "entrepreneurship." "Entrepreneurship"
is something you learn best by doing it. The examples of the most successful founders make that clear. What you should
be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future. College is an incomparable opportunity to do
that. What a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup ‚Äî becoming the sort of
person who can have organic startup ideas ‚Äî by spending time learning about the easy part. Especially since you won't
even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn about sex in a class. All you'll learn is the words for things.  
  
The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start
learning about some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could solve. In fact, you're doubly likely
to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have
already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don't even
know what the status quo is to take it for granted.  
  
So if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you're better off
taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a biotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at
computer hardware or software companies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job
in some unrelated field. \[8\]  
  
Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started
in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they're supposed
to be studying for finals. \[9\]  
  
But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build
things. Preferably with other students. It's not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank
oneself into the future. You're also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing. If you work together with
them on projects, you'll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams ‚Äî and
that, empirically, is the best combination.  
  
Beware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it's quite likely to represent a good
startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as
research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup. \[10\] I think the reason is that
the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint
would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users' problems. Whereas when students (or professors) build
something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward solving users' problems ‚Äî perhaps even with an
additional energy that comes from being freed from the constraints of research.

### **Competition**

Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll tend to feel that you're late. Don't let that deter
you. Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle
the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally
rare for startups to be killed by competitors ‚Äî so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you
discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.  
  
If you're uncertain, ask users. The question of whether you're too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone
urgently needs what you plan to make. If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users
urgently need, you have a beachhead. \[11\]  
  
The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more importantly, who's in it: if the beachhead consists
of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it's probably big enough no matter how
small it is. For example, if you're building something differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on
phones, but it only works on the newest phones, that's probably a big enough beachhead.  
  
Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more
credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea
with competitors than a bad one without.  
  
You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is
overlooking. In fact that's a very promising starting point. Google was that type of idea. Your thesis has to be more
precise than "we're going to make an x that doesn't suck" though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something
the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn't have the courage of their convictions,
and that your plan is what they'd have done if they'd followed through on their own insights. Google was that type of
idea too. The search engines that preceded them shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing ‚Äî
particularly that the better a job they did, the faster users would leave.  
  
A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there's demand and that none of the existing
solutions are good enough. A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously big and yet in which they have no
competitors. So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed
with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which
will turn out to be big (like Microsoft). \[12\]

### **Filters**

There are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep
filter.  
  
Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having
users pay them lots of money. They'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the
real world. Which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread
that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down
the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.  
  
The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces, which I called [schlep
blindness](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html). I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning
off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is. Thousands of programmers were in a position to see this idea;
thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before Stripe. But when they looked for startup
ideas they didn't see this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments. And dealing with
payments is a schlep for Stripe, but not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less pain; because the fear
of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing in other
areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition. They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by
users, because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.  
  
The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps you from working on problems you despise rather than
ones you fear. We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting things about the architecture of our
software, but we weren't interested in ecommerce per se. We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved
though.  
  
Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more
likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form of self-indulgence. Starting a successful
startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. Even if the product doesn't entail a lot of schleps, you'll
still have plenty dealing with investors, hiring and firing people, and so on. So if there's some idea you think would
be cool but you're kept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as
many.  
  
The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter. If you're at the
leading edge of a field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will be somewhat correlated with what's
valuable in practice. Particularly as you get older and more experienced. Plus if you find an idea sexy, you'll work on
it more enthusiastically. \[13\]

### **Recipes**

While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them and then build whatever
interests you, sometimes you don't have that luxury. Sometimes you need an idea now. For example, if you're working on a
startup and your initial idea turns out to be bad.  
  
For the rest of this essay I'll talk about tricks for coming up with startup ideas on demand. Although empirically
you're better off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You just have to be more disciplined. When you
use the organic method, you don't even notice an idea unless it's evidence that something is truly missing. But when you
make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with self-discipline.
You'll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad, so you need to be able to filter them.  
  
One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of the organic method. Organic ideas feel like
inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy
idea but "just knew" it was promising. When you feel that about an idea you've had while trying to come up with startup
ideas, you're probably mistaken.  
  
When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you're a database expert, don't build a chat
app for teenagers (unless you're also a teenager). Maybe it's a good idea, but you can't trust your judgment about that,
so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard
to come up with good ideas involving databases? That's because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas about
chat apps are just as bad, but you're giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.  
  
The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There *must* be things you need. \[14\]  
  
One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying "Why doesn't someone make
x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second." If you can think of any x people said that about, you probably have an
idea. You know there's demand, and people don't say that about things that are impossible to build.  
  
More generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual about you that makes your needs different from
most other people's. You're probably not the only one. It's especially good if you're different in a way people will
increasingly be.  
  
If you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you'd previously been working on. Did you discover any
needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this way. Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to
talk about their previous startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. \[15\]  
  
A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young. Some of the most valuable new ideas take root first among
people in their teens and early twenties. And while young founders are at a disadvantage in some respects, they're the
only ones who really understand their peers. It would have been very hard for someone who wasn't a college student to
start Facebook. So if you're a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do that
current technology won't let you?  
  
The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try talking to everyone you can about
the gaps they find in the world. What's missing? What would they like to do that they can't? What's tedious or annoying,
particularly in their work? Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You're
just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously realize they had,
because you know how to solve it.  
  
When you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat blurry at first. The person who needs something may
not know exactly what they need. In that case I often recommend that founders act like consultants ‚Äî that they do what
they'd do if they'd been retained to solve the problems of this one user. People's problems are similar enough that
nearly all the code you write this way will be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to start out certain
that you've reached the bottom of the well. \[16\]  
  
One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems is to make them your own. When Rajat Suri of E la
Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem
like taking things to extremes, but startups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.  
  
In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy
filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. Don't try to start Twitter. Those ideas are so rare
that you can't find them by looking for them. Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.  
  
A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would
build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?  
  
Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to look for those that are
dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise. For example, journalism is
in free fall at the moment. But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism. What sort of company
might cause people in the future to say "this replaced journalism" on some axis?  
  
But imagine asking that in the future, not now. When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from
the side. So don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a
replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for
example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention,
and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already
started to be on most).  
  
When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players
ignore. It's particularly good if there's an admixture of disdain in the big players' attitude, because that often
misleads them. For example, after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he felt obliged to give his
then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option to produce it. Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one of the reasons
they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which seemed intolerably d√©class√© to a high-end hardware company like HP
was at the time. \[17\]  
  
Are there groups of [scruffy](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html) but sophisticated users like the early
microcomputer "hobbyists" that are currently being ignored by the big players? A startup with its sights set on bigger
things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn't be justified by that market alone.  
  
Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick
to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. The prices of gene sequencing and 3D printing are both
experiencing Moore's Law-like declines. What new things will we be able to do in the new world we'll have in a few
years? What are we unconsciously ruling out as impossible that will soon be possible?

### **Organic**

But talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas.
Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you're at the leading edge of some rapidly
changing field, you don't have to look for waves; you are the wave.  
  
Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn't work well
simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The best
approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But
even then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing. And often these
gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to build. Which is why it's good to
have the time and the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.  
  
Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that's the real recipe.

### **Notes**

\[1\] This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web. It was common in the 1990s, except then people who had
it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x. Structurally the idea is
stone soup: you post a sign saying "this is the place for people interested in x," and all those people show up and you
make money from them. What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who might
be interested in each type of x. What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard,
and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.  
  
\[2\] I'm not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea. I know it's a
bad idea the way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism. The set of plausible sounding
startup ideas is many times larger than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don't even sound that plausible.
So if all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.  
  
\[3\] More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make,
which can vary a lot. For example, the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is
very high, so you'd have to be a\_lot\_better to get users to switch. Whereas the activation energy required to switch
to a new search engine is low. Which in turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise software.  
  
\[4\] This gets harder as you get older. While the space of ideas doesn't have dangerous local maxima, the space of
careers does. There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take through life, and the older you get, the
higher the walls become.  
  
\[5\] It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big deal. Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but
the programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.  
  
\[6\] Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal, and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps
and anomalies you'd noticed that day. Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and anomalies.  
  
\[7\] Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute
sense, but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.  
  
There's comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because few founders are willing to put in the time
required to notice them. Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas, because when people make up
startup ideas, they tend to make up the same ones.  
  
\[8\] For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs are the first phase of the recruiting funnel. But if
you're good you can skip the first phase. If you're good you'll have no trouble getting hired by these companies when
you graduate, regardless of how you spent your summers.  
  
\[9\] The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help their students start startups, the best thing they
can do is leave them alone in the right way.  
  
\[10\] I'm speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.  
  
\[11\] This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users, not competitors. The most important information about
competitors is what you learn via users anyway.  
  
\[12\] In practice most successful startups have elements of both. And you can describe each strategy in terms of the
other by adjusting the boundaries of what you call the market. But it's useful to consider these two ideas separately.  
  
\[13\] I almost hesitate to raise that point though. Startups are businesses; the point of a business is to make money;
and with that additional constraint, you can't expect you'll be able to spend all your time working on what interests
you most.  
  
\[14\] The need has to be a strong one. You can retroactively describe any made-up idea as something you need. But do
you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and
Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?  
  
Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders "Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?" and you'd
be surprised how often the answer is no.  
  
\[15\] Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad can be a source of better ideas:  
  
"The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product
ASAP (before wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building, they very often
come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea."  
  
\[16\] Here's a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if you're college students. If you have a connection to one
of the more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees thereof and offer to be their personal IT
consultants, building anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that didn't already exist. Anything that
got built this way would be very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding but also the perfect
point to spread from.  
  
I have no idea whether this would work.  
  
\[17\] And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak started out by solving his own problems. He, like
most of his peers, couldn't afford a monitor.

**Introduction**

In his 2007 essay ‚Äú[Why to Not Not Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html),‚Äù YC co-founder Paul Graham
wrote about how common uncertainty was among people considering starting a company. ‚ÄúThere's nothing wrong with being
unsure,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of a grand tradition.‚Äù When Y Combinator launched in 2005, [starting a startup was an
unusual career path for recent graduates](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html). It was hard to be taken seriously by
investors if you didn‚Äôt have an MBA or years of experience in business or tech. To get a sense of how many startups were
in the world, look at TechCrunch in 2005. It published about 40 company launches per month, and YC itself only got a
couple hundred applications for its first batches.

The world has changed since then. Today we get tens of thousands of applications per year. On any given day you can look
on Product Hunt and see dozens of new companies launch. Taking a chance and starting a startup is not the foreign
concept it once was.

While it has become more common for people around the world to start startups, there are many more who could consider
startups as an option. For example, lots of folks choose a career in finance or as an engineer at a big company without
considering other options. Whether you know you want to become a founder or are more interested in finding a job at a
startup, we want to equip you with the best resources for getting started.

In this guide, we‚Äôll discuss why you should think about starting a startup and why you should consider not starting a
startup. We‚Äôll also talk about what you should do in college and walk-through some tips for applying to Y Combinator.
And if it turns out being a founder isn‚Äôt for you, we‚Äôll talk about how to choose the right company and the benefits of
working at a startup.

## **1.** **Why Start a Startup?**

Startups are not for everyone. The hours are long, the route to success is often unconventional, and it is certainly not
a surefire way to make a large sum of money. Roughly 90 percent of startups end in failure. (YC is an exception; over 50
percent of YC companies that are over five years old are still alive). Why would anyone choose this as a career?

**Ask Yourself Three Questions**

‚ÄúThere is a certain type of person who only works at their peak capacity when there is no predictable path to follow,‚Äù
YC alum and group partner Michael Seibel writes in his essay, [Why Should I Start a Startup?
](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/60-why-should-i-start-a-startup)‚ÄúThe odds of success are low, and they have to
take personal responsibility for failure.‚Äù

To determine if a startup is right for you, Michael recommends asking yourself these three things:

**Do I like being the underdog?**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qKws75hwjJP8drgrWoOI_0sArFWiKr6Y83YRB24_MSQeqD3JzQsRo5b5z05Fn4-SJHvJnSib1Wp4E6rsEmSk5ZXEeGMehIa54NcHJ2ijbBYk9pwjTx1FZ14o03ivc3HWJbqu6D2d)

**Do I seek hard challenges most people shy away from?**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7Is5kHabdOgRoQc9awvyux4srMiS8xMG9-KoCKFbg6LOuEg74-fMb4jHa3-JyDyNMDgChongG1yJCNjfH70K6gp_OwJKd9kdFiwcPnuIeqZM_dU1KidR04wmUBJ7CMlwU2SUrvR7)

**Do I thrive taking personal responsibility for success or failure?**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YmAiqjaL43LEHVAnu6GdDqGA3D-6c0M7C_BIhN2cl9HS3OBkEiqIgb_70ZKPAzVUR2l9RWhVv795wchVMesKFH5kRvhRwLb4jDVBVLrxoR2013E3UiCHWuNRrBl9pFaSCWHRxuKE)

‚ÄúIf you answer yes three times, then maybe starting a startup is for you,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúI cannot promise that doing a
tech startup will make you rich but I can promise that it is one of the most challenging things you can choose to do.‚Äù
Starting a startup is both awesomely challenging, and often the most rewarding journey you will ever take.

**Find a Problem You‚Äôre Obsessed With Solving**

Some of the most successful companies in YC history formed when founders confronted a real world issue. Airbnb began
in 2007 when Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were having trouble paying rent, so they bought a few air mattresses and
charged people $80 per night to sleep on them during a busy convention in San Francisco. In 2010, Patrick and John
Collison began working on the side project that would later become Stripe after Patrick became fed up with how hard it
was to accept financial payments on the internet. The founders of Gusto started their company because they were
frustrated by the inefficiencies in payroll for small businesses.

You don‚Äôt necessarily need to start with a specific idea. Simply take a look at your own life, identify a problem, and
then build a solution. You might be surprised how many others have the same problem too.

**Be Prepared to Own Every Success and Every Failure**

Steve Jobs once said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more fun to be a pirate than join the Navy.‚Äù Part of the appeal of startups is the ability
to run fast with a lean team that operates without bureaucracy. But it also means there‚Äôs no corporate cushion either.
As a founder you‚Äôre responsible for every setback when things go wrong, but at the same time, you will stand to gain
more than any corporate job could ever offer if your startup is successful.

## **2.** **Why Not Start a Startup**

<strong>You‚Äôre Still in School</strong> <br> <br> Startups take an enormous amount of time and energy. If you decide to
build one while still enrolled in college, your grades and social life will almost certainly suffer.

That being said, it‚Äôs not impossible. The founders of Panorama Education formed their edtech company while they were
undergraduates at Yale. Co-founder Aaron Feurer says he spent over forty hours a week building Panorama and, by the time
he graduated, they had amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.

This kind of success is very difficult to achieve and highly uncommon. Also, keep in mind that if your startup begins to
scale, you‚Äôll most likely have to drop out. There are, however, benefits to staying in college, and later we‚Äôll share
the best ways to prepare to start a company while you‚Äôre in school.

**It‚Äôs Difficult**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WGGM-_ImkU5W2h-cU6K8sJ2E3hLm4CGJ2k1-Fom9GHr9590aPlrhg_TlyUTkJ7rJfVgii1bncE8lac4qTwSkbcObOonCmftkArM_nniQa2UyOqscvohgW6Uq3ZUVX-4awb_2kdJJ)

Building a company from scratch is mentally and emotionally taxing, and it‚Äôs usually too much for one person to manage.
The odds are against you too ‚Äî as we mentioned before, nine out of 10 startups fail in their first year ‚Äî and the ones
that do succeed face immense challenges.

**You Have No Co-Founder**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/COgvqtoSayIo-qZIAhLwYEkYtFssmdxAPLCvJIrCqUDZrmlEZGfbGM6ejhdoidfqYa0eiO98qRaBPAqca7ISgUEt76ODYIFqLbgaH94cXNrTCM2Irwdv8bjfkcMVMTSV661lgDPf)

If you look at YC‚Äôs [top companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies) list, only 7.9 percent were founded by
solo founders. A co- founder not only gives you someone to split tasks with, but also helps you bear the emotional
weight of building a startup, and can fill gaps in expertise. One co-founder might be a talented programmer while the
other is great at sales.

College is an ideal place to find a co-founder. But if you‚Äôve exhausted both your first and second level networks and
still haven‚Äôt found the right person to start a company with, [YC‚Äôs new co-founder matching
platform](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching) can pair you with a co-founder based on skills, interests,
and location.

**You‚Äôre Not Ready for the Commitment**

Even if you‚Äôre successful, [it will take years ](https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/startup-exit/)for your company to
have an exit or IPO. While it‚Äôs impossible to predict exactly how long, you should prepare yourself to work relentlessly
for as long as a decade on your startup. If spending time on things like travel and hobbies right now is more appealing
than starting your own company, that's ok. But it‚Äôs probably not the ideal time for you to start a startup.

**You Need Structure**

The structure inherent in large corporations has some benefits. Managers and bosses can act as mentors, and being part
of a large collaborative team can sometimes coax out brilliant ideas from smart people. But if you need structure to
thrive, a startup may not be the ideal place for you.

**You Hate Uncertainty**

At a startup, there is no clear linear path to success. If the idea of uncertainty gives you hives, don't do a startup.

## **3. Bad Reasons For Not Starting a Startup**

<strong>You Don't Have an Idea</strong> <br>
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HDxogzwKPdX25SIAX_S_RtuFvCAjDFB_0Kxwu60bRWsvMTngu6sjLpnd_6pXe71LrBPjFsuctN56XPaqabiv2Vw8lGk6tNDGtqdauHuPIX0wdTF9UkZ4mAtq6Ob4IIOYDRgAsCua)

At Y Combinator [we put more emphasis on the team than the
idea](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6p-all-about-pivoting) because time and time again we‚Äôve seen companies pivot
after they discovered a newer, more urgent problem to solve. Reddit, Brex, and Segment were all accepted into YC as
completely different concepts before pivoting into the companies they are today.

If you‚Äôre unsure of an idea to work on, we have the following resources to help you begin.

  - [Startup School: How to Get Startup Ideas](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/8g-how-to-get-startup-ideas)
  - [Startup School: How to Evaluate Startup
    Ideas](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6e-how-to-evaluate-startup-ideas)
  - [Paul Graham: How to Get Startup Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

**Your Parents Want You** **to Get a Real Job**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FMXXB6wb70CwdgaukwWusu7kPJJqCh2rfkGNntSsZn290rSIw7LOCNcKJd46pDWCr1MAsfMu7JahGTaFaTtaMZP71VCTX-v7yFY5q-vl-PQr5idROkhZRMO4LpBxxOU31763ZB2i)

Parental pressure seems like less of a problem for startup founders (at least in the US) today than it was a decade ago.
When *The Social Network* came out in 2012, YC got a massive spike in applications. We sometimes joke that *The Social
Network* was the cultural inflection point where parents realized startups could be a viable and lucrative career
option. If your parents are still skeptical about a career in startups, show them stories about
[Brex](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/how-the-22-year-old-founders-of-brex-built-a-billion-dollar-business-in-less-than-2-years/),
[Stripe](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/20/the-story-behind-payment-disruptor-stripe-com-and-its-founder-patrick-collison/),
[Embark](https://observer.com/2021/06/electric-autonomous-truck-embark-spac-go-public-young-billionaire/) and [Scale
AI](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/scale-ai-machine-learning-startup-alexandr-wang/). These companies,
founded by people in their 20s, are all massively successful and now worth billions of dollars.

**You Have Student Loans**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8GS0KVsQg0zOqoX_etSZQxyFzjfCnVMPbKI_yjNfCimgECZL14Jz2qINVmjxG0OuyPnvbcBdz3mJJjXB3VlRZeckldt37lwWBffKXERvbe0FmELLtKGkHp44SYFFBL21O4UPpm-A)

It‚Äôs not impossible to start a company if you have a lot of student debt. But it is a lot harder. Having large student
loan payments every month certainly makes a well paying job at a big company more enticing. And once you have steady
income, it‚Äôs easy to start racking up additional expenses like nice cars, fancy vacations, and luxury apartments.
Leaving a salary behind is tough.

While it‚Äôs true that start-ups only rarely generate great wealth, it‚Äôs also important to remember being part of a
startup is typically a force multiplier for experience, knowledge, and ability to execute ‚Äî all things that will
increase earning potential.

## **4. Why Work At a Startup**

There‚Äôs no better way to learn about startups than by working at one ‚Äî especially a YC startup. You‚Äôll gain experience
building products that people love, talk to customers directly, and get a transparent view of the business. (And it
might just become the next Airbnb, DoorDash, or Coinbase.)

Here‚Äôs the best way to gain that experience.

**Visit YC‚Äôs Work at a Startup**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lJwhFR4_huqPjy7Hk3c7y9JSoGmghw4n3TRR5Y9paugw14Nr4eXD-ki9QzlzCv6ug0bYpPZnr9zoV4TNTT9JSliqhtDUF2Op91SeTBCfSBMzJze2KAPv7SI9PEZ7NaPZtjTpeei9)

YC‚Äôs [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs) helps you apply to multiple startups with the same resume
and also allows founders to get in touch with you directly if they think your skills might be a good fit for a role. If
you‚Äôre looking for an internship, YC companies also list active internships on the [YC internships
page](https://www.workatastartup.com/internships).

**Determine the Right Company**

Find a startup that‚Äôs solving a problem that‚Äôs interesting to you. Are you obsessed with mitigating the impacts of
climate change? Or maybe you want to focus on the intersection of robotics and biotech? [YC‚Äôs Work at a Startup jobs
page](https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs) lists positions at thousands of companies working on the world‚Äôs toughest
challenges.

If you find a startup that interests you but doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs hiring, reach out to the founders. A single email
can open doors you might not even realize are there. [Read
here](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4l-advice-for-job-seekers-on-resumes-and-reaching-out) for more tips on what a
good outreach message might look like.

**Decide What Stage Startup is Right For You**

For an internship, we recommend being at a post series A company. There‚Äôs more structure and more capacity for
mentorship. However, if there‚Äôs a particular founder you‚Äôd really like to learn from, or if you‚Äôre a very self-directed
learner and worker who thrives in ever-changing environments, a seed stage company could be a good option.

**Ask The Founders These Questions**

If possible, get in touch with the founders and ask the following questions. The responses will give you valuable
insight on what your experience will be like and what you‚Äôll learn.

**What will I work on during this internship?**

To maximize learning, get a sense of the projects you‚Äôll be working on and the skills you‚Äôll be developing. This might
include contributing to the tech stack, helping increase metrics, or working closely with customers. Bonus if the
project ships at the end of your internship ‚Äî you‚Äôll have something concrete to add to your resume.

**Will I get to see how the business is doing?** **How much do I get to interact with customers?**

One of the benefits of working at a startup is the transparency of a small team and being closer to the business. (Many
engineers at large companies never even know who their customers are\!) Talking to customers not only allows you to see
how the business is improving ‚Äî or not improving ‚Äî but is also a key skill set when you‚Äôre running your own startup.

**What will I learn from the people I‚Äôm working with?**

Whether it‚Äôs an internship or your first full-time position, bosses, coworkers, or even the founders are a great
resource for helping you grow and learn. Carefully study their strengths ‚Äî are they good at analytics, product
development, building MVPs, or performing customer interviews? ‚Äî and use that to understand what skills you‚Äôll need to
cultivate.

Lastly, if you‚Äôre looking for a full-time role, we also recommend asking about runway and burn rate. This will tell you
if the startup is in a good funding situation and show how transparent the founders are. You can[ read more about both
here.](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4l-advice-for-job-seekers-on-resumes-and-reaching-out)

## **5.** **Startup School**

If you‚Äôre interested in starting a startup but haven‚Äôt decided on what to work on, you can explore [Startup
School](https://www.startupschool.org/)‚Äôs Aspiring Founders track. This free, online course runs for six weeks and is
designed for anyone thinking about founding a startup ‚Äî students, engineers, creatives ‚Äî but not actively working on one
right now.

The curriculum features lectures like ‚Äú[How to Get Startup
Ideas](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/8g-how-to-get-startup-ideas)‚Äù and ‚Äú[How to Plan an
MVP](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp)‚Äù. It also includes exercises that can help put what
you‚Äôve learned into practice.

Once you‚Äôre ready to start working on your company in earnest, a good next step is to check out the rest of [Startup
School](https://www.startupschool.org/)‚Äôs curriculum. This program, which we also offer for free, consists of founders
who can help you learn about startups, build a product, and track growth. They also run periodic build sprints that many
founders utilize as a catalyst for launching a company.

Additionally there‚Äôs also a free repository of content at the [YC Library](https://www.ycombinator.com/library), which
includes more than 15 years worth of startup advice, podcasts, and essays.

## **6.** **Applying to YC**

YC funds two batches of startups per year. One in the winter and one in the summer. While we take applications all year
long, we have an early and a regular submission deadline for specific batches.

Once you‚Äôre ready to work on your startup full time, you can [apply for the next

**Lifetime Support**

The Y Combinator program doesn't end on demo day. We continue to assist founders from idea through IPO and beyond. YC
starts with teaching founders the basics of [starting a company](https://www.startupschool.org/), [finding
customers](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/), [raising angel investments](https://demoday.ycombinator.com/), and
[hiring their first employees](https://www.workatastartup.com/). Then we help founders secure[ Series A and B
funding](https://blog.ycombinator.com/introducing-yc-series-a-batches/) [scale their
companies](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-stage-program/), and hire an executive team. Once a YC company has scaled
to a certain level, we may [invest in later stage rounds](https://www.ycombinator.com/continuity/).

Y Combinator boasts the strongest and deepest founder community in the world. For the 6,000+ YC alumni, there‚Äôs always
someone to help guide them through every stage of their business; and with over 3,000 companies funded, founders have a
built-in cohort of customers ready to try their products and services.

**Well Known Resources**

Being part of Y Combinator will give your company numerous advantages in a highly competitive market. YC companies tend
to raise more money from better investors and achieve higher valuations. Our applications are open to anyone ‚Äî you don‚Äôt
need to be well connected in the tech or investment world to be accepted. Our team dispenses meaningful advice on
everything from growth strategies to overcoming technical hurdles to communicating with press and media.

**Secret Resources**

Some of the lesser known advantages to being part of Y Combinator are access to the massive, vibrant YC alumni network,
the YC-only hiring platform, [Work at a Startup](http://workatastartup.com/), plus better deals and more customers.

**What is a day in the life of a founder in the batch?**

Every day will have its own unique chaos. In general, expect to be writing code, talking to users, solving problems, and
participating in weekly batch events, group activities, and office hours.

**What does YC look for in companies and founders?**

There‚Äôs no magic template for creating founders or companies. We do, however, often find these qualities in the most
successful ones.

**Technical Ability**

We like to see teams that have the ability to build, usually that means having a technical founder.

**A Drive to Build**

We do fund ideas. About 60 percent of the companies we fund don‚Äôt have a launched product, but we like founders who have
an inclination for action and are making fast progress on what they‚Äôre working on.

**Persistence and Resilience**

A number of companies apply to YC multiple times before being accepted. These days, about 50 percent of the companies we
fund have applied more than once. If a founder applies a second time, it‚Äôs important they show they‚Äôve made progress on
their company. This signals a founder is serious about building a startup.

**What stage and sector does YC invest in?**

We have companies in each batch that don‚Äôt have a fully formed idea and companies that have millions of dollars in
revenue.

We invest in companies from a broad range of industries ranging from consumer apps to biotech to SAAS. See the whole
range of companies and industries [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies).

**What are the requirements to apply to YC?**

Y Combinator is open to everyone and [the application is free](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/).

**Are there different requirements for international founders?**

There are no different requirements for international founders. For the Summer 2021 batch, about half of the companies
were internationally based.

**Do I need a business plan?**

You do not need a business plan to apply to YC. Our application process usually helps founders understand more about why
and what they are trying to build.

*Tip:* Be concise and explain your idea simply.

## **7.** **Alternatives to Starting a Startup**

If you‚Äôve decided that being a startup founder isn‚Äôt right for you, there are still many other avenues open in the tech
industry. Here‚Äôs a few resources that can help.

Ultimately, you should join a startup if learning trumps stability, if experience beats structure, and if building
things wins out over a steady paycheck. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the company succeeds or fails, when you join a startup
you‚Äôre going to gain knowledge and experiences that you will find nowhere else.

## **8.** **Frequently Asked Questions From Students**

**What Classes Should I Be Taking in College?**

There are no specific classes where you will learn to be a founder. Take courses you enjoy and work on projects that
interest you. These experiences will likely teach you more than anything in academia.

**Does it Matter What Degree I Have?**

Not really. If you enjoy coding, having a computer science or engineering degree is the best way to set yourself up for
success. If engineering is not something you want to focus on, college is a great place to find people who have skills
that are complementary to yours. That being said, if you want to run a software company, we recommend teaching yourself
the basics of coding, even if you‚Äôre not planning to be the CTO. Understanding how software works is a critical part of
building and running a technology company.

**What Skills Should I Be Learning?**

You don‚Äôt need to go to a specific school or have a specific degree to be a good founder. However, developing these
three skills in college will undoubtedly help in a career as a founder later on.

**Coding**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dhNFgnG94DxapBL-i1eqxxUZouAzus7XQLW6IpU0MZfMKJMovV_GIy6Pb36BRoU5xDtI34CO5TWc26ANIvATEVpjchOLw3CRO5x8fF7ou3P3yj_mGS3VjKk8MbL0lrnvCgWiGWgH)

Learn to code and become friends with technical folks. You can‚Äôt build a software enabled company without software.

**Communication**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TUHPzjpmIj_VD7_rCY1kjvOkDCi3-Y9Jk-eSWq0HeQ-Jf1pw4qrAXlcjVI2G769U9LikGfw_xzGHwkZLICVntxqK47UEe3hKx2hBcJ0iezJBqTRmG4LT5B4WxfrpwtWkPA5ETJV2)

Learn to convey your ideas clearly and simply. Think of it this way: even if you‚Äôre working on something enormously
complex you have to be able to explain it in a way your grandparents will understand.

**People Skills**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MK2XG11pYtcUCqJ6Sza-vZVQ5DZrYbrLStjiZHYgsYWEY_lLquPS3Kpfs630z1uhilvzX0FF0Cvq5CP7GVTXFjJe1WVlqZ2T8MBUCJiLhuQbBA4FNMIMtqqxXiiWt2VPDvrV-_TO)

Build your network. Meet potential co-founders. Gain a deeper understanding of what people's needs are. As a founder,
it‚Äôs crucial to talk to users so you can better solve their problems.

**How Should I Spend My Time at School?**

For most, college is a one time experience and we encourage you to enjoy it. It‚Äôs the ideal period to explore subjects
that fascinate you and find like minded people you enjoy working with.

College is one of the best places to meet a potential co-founder. Build your network and become friends with people who
you could potentially work with in the future.

Also, don‚Äôt forget that you also have access to the entire world. Experts in all kinds of fields ‚Äî technology, business,
science ‚Äî are usually happy to help college students.

For more advice on how to spend your time during university read [A Letter to College
Students](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4d-a-letter-to-college-students) by Michael Siebel.

**Can I Still be a Founder Without a Technical Background?**

YC has funded some startups that don‚Äôt have a technical co-founder. Roughly ten percent of the companies in every batch
are founded by a non-technical founder. However, if you look at [YC‚Äôs Top
Companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies) list you‚Äôll only see 3 companies founded by a non-technical
founder: Flexport, SnapDocs and UpKeep. If you are non-technical, we highly recommend finding a technical co-founder if
you‚Äôre building a software company. With someone technical on the team, you can move quickly and have a greater chance
of success.

**How Do I Meet a Cofounder?**

The most common way people meet their co-founders is through school and work. We looked at the top performing YC
companies to see how the founders connected with each other. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

**YC‚Äôs TOP COMPANIES (68 entries)**

\**A good way to get started is working on projects or extracurricular activities with your classmates.*

YC‚Äôs Startup School also recently launched a [co-founder matching
platform](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching). We pair you with co-founders based on your preferences for
interests, skills, location, and more. While we don‚Äôt suggest you immediately start a company with someone you meet on
this platform, it is a great way to connect with like-minded people who are interested in starting a company. You still
need to do the hard work of building a strong, trusting relationship.

**How do I decide on the idea?**

When landing on a concept for a startup, keep these three items in mind. But as we‚Äôve said before, ideas can easily be
changed.

<ul padding-left: 15x;> <strong>1.</strong> Intention matters <br> We‚Äôve found the best YC founders are solving problems that they or a loved one have personally faced. Think about why you want to solve the problem you‚Äôre solving. Will you care about it a decade from now? <br> <br> <strong>2.</strong> Don't follow the mainstream <br> Doing something because it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúcool'' will likely not be successful. When Coinbase was founded in 2012, cryptocurrencies were very much a fringe idea. Today it‚Äôs pretty likely your grandmother has heard of Bitcoin. <br> <br> <strong>3.</strong> Solve for needs <br> It‚Äôs tricky to balance an understanding of what people want versus what they need. Focus on what people are actually willing to spend their time or money on, not just what they say they want. <br> <br> For more, watch <a href=https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6G-how-to-build-the-future>How to Build the Future with YC‚Äôs Sam Altman</a>. <br></ul>

**I‚Äôve built something. How do I get my first users or customers?**

<ul padding-left: 15x;> <strong>1.</strong> College campus. <br> A great part of being on a college campus is that you have easy access to a large pool of potential customers who are likely to try something new. <br> <br> <strong>2.</strong> Friends and family. <br> Ask everyone you know ‚Äì aunts, grandparents, cousins, friends, acquaintances ‚Äî to use your product. This will help you determine your ideal demographic. <br> </ul>

**Should I charge for my product?**

Charge for your product as soon as possible. The amount doesn‚Äôt need to be very much, but charging will help you
understand how much value you‚Äôre creating and how much people are willing to spend on what you‚Äôre building.

**How do I convince my parents that starting a startup is a smart idea?**

Share stories of successful young founders. John and Patrick Collison were 19 and 21 respectively when they started
Stripe. Alex Rodrigues of Embark Trucks was just 19 when he founded his company.

Inform them how startup experience is valuable, even if the company fails. There will always be corporate jobs and many
YC founders join big companies when their startups shutter.

Also remind them startups are easier when you‚Äôre younger. It‚Äôs true you can start a startup at any age, but when you
have lots of energy and little commitments, it‚Äôs much easier to spend time building.

**Should I finish my degree or dropout and pursue my startup?**

We tell most students to finish their degree. But if the only thing you can do is think about your startup and you‚Äôre
spending all your free time working on it, it might be worth considering dropping out.

July 2007  
  
An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of your startup. Should you take it? You're about to hire
your first employee. How much stock should you give him?  
  
These are some of the hardest questions founders face. And yet both have the same answer:  
  
1/(1 - n)  
  
Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether it's money or an employee or a deal with another
company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for
improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was
before.  
  
For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how much does that investment have to improve your average
outcome for you to break even? Obviously it has to double: if you trade half your company for something that more than
doubles the company's average outcome, you're net ahead. You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice
as much.  
  
In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the
company worth more than 1/(1 - n).  
  
For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 7% of your company. In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 -
n) is 1.075. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 7.5%. If we
improve your outcome by 10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth .93 x 1.1 = 1.023. \[1\]  
  
One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a
really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when Sequoia invests alone they like to
take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve your outcome by more
than 43%. For the average startup, that would be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup's
prospects by more than 43% just to be able to *say* they were funded by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the
money.  
  
The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of the company they take is artificially low. They don't
even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel
the company is still theirs.  
  
The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this
great deal are 1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups.  
  
Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal. It's never just a straight trade of money for stock. But if
it were, taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.  
  
You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other direction. If i is the average
outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n). Which means
n = (i - 1)/i.  
  
For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll
increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. So you'll break even if you
trade 16.7% of the company for him.  
  
That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's
usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there's no reason to do it.  
  
I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. Most startups grow
fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of
next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a
new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation. \[2\]  
  
How much of an additional margin should the company need as the "activation energy" for the deal? Since this is in
effect the company's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if you're a hot opportunity, you can charge
more.  
  
Let's run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a "profit" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So
subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his "retail" price. Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year
in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k total. If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an
offer of 6.6%.  
  
Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to take little salary. It comes right out of stock that
could otherwise be given to them.  
  
Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers. I'm not claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a
formula. Ultimately you always have to guess. But at least know what you're guessing. If you choose a number based on
your gut feel, or a table of typical grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates of.  
  
And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity, run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense. You
should always feel richer after trading equity. If the trade didn't increase the value of your remaining shares enough
to put you net ahead, you wouldn't have (or shouldn't have) done it.  
  
  
  
**Notes**  
  
\[1\] This is why we can't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal. Does anyone really think we're so
useless that in three months we can't improve a startup's prospects by 7.5%?  
  
\[2\] The obvious choice for your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last funding round. This
probably undervalues the company, though, because (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is presumably
worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding round usually reflects some other contribution by the investors.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html)

October 2015  
  
When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or 9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost
always the same. Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth is what it has been over the last
several months, do they make it to profitability on the money they have left? Or to put it more dramatically, by default
do they live or die?  
  
The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know. Half the founders I talk to don't know whether
they're default alive or default dead.  
  
If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy [calculator](http://growth.tlb.org/#) you can use to find
out.  
  
The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest of the conversation
depends on the answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious new things they could do. If it's
default dead, we probably need to talk about how to save it. We know the current trajectory ends badly. How can they get
off that trajectory?  
  
Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead? Mainly, I think, because they're not used to
asking that. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how
he plans to support himself. But as the company grows older, the question switches from meaningless to critical. That
kind of switch often takes people by surprise.  
  
I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead,
start asking too early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity. But it's probably not that
dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too
late.  
  
The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the [fatal pinch](http://www.paulgraham.com/pinch.html). The fatal
pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed.  
  
There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default dead: they assume it will
be easy to raise more money. But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the more you depend on it, the falser
it becomes.  
  
Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking of the future with vague optimism, explicitly
separate the components. Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save us." Maybe as you say that, it
will set off the same alarms in your head that it does in mine. And if you set off the alarms sufficiently early, you
may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.  
  
It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors saving you. As a rule their interest is a function
of growth. If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you can start to count on investors being interested
even if you're not profitable. \[1\] But investors are so fickle that you can never do more than start to count on them.
Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great. So no matter how good your
growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely
when you'll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.  
  
In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. In
practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup
grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. When a
startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're
wasteful.  
  
If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being
default dead. That one is easy: don't hire too fast. Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise
money. \[2\]  
  
Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather
than underestimating it. Why? Partly because there's so much work to do. Naive founders think that if they can just hire
enough people, it will all get done. Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's
what one does in order to be successful. In fact the large staffs of successful startups are probably more the effect of
growth than the cause. And partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to face what is usually the
real reason: the product is not appealing enough.  
  
Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to overhire by the VCs who funded them. Kill-or-cure
strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect. VCs want to blow you up, in one sense
of the phrase or the other. But as a founder your incentives are different. You want above all to survive. \[3\]  
  
Here's a common way startups die. They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise
their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible. But because the product
is only moderately appealing, growth is ok but not great. The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people
is the way to boost growth. Their investors agree. But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth
never comes. Now they're rapidly running out of runway. They hope further investment will save them. But because they
have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company
dies.  
  
What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing.
Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. More often than not it makes it harder. At this early stage, the product
needs to evolve more than to be "built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people. \[4\]  
  
Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you from this. Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will
counteract the forces that push you to overhire. Instead you'll be compelled to seek growth in other ways. For example,
by [doing things that don't scale](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html), or by redesigning the product in the way only
founders can. And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be the ones that actually work.  
  
Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y¬†Combinator before they hired their first employee. In the
meantime the founders were terribly overworked. But they were overworked evolving Airbnb into the astonishingly
successful organism it is now.  
  
  
  
  
  
**Notes**  
  
\[1\] Steep usage growth will also interest investors. Revenue will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x%
usage growth predicts x% revenue growth. But in practice investors discount merely predicted revenue, so if you're
measuring usage you need a higher growth rate to impress investors.  
  
\[2\] Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean
you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to
avoid becoming an alcoholic.  
  
\[3\] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest. They
don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived. My guess
is a significant number.  
  
\[4\] After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:  
  
"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly. I think it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful
companies have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great founder is being able to resist this
urge."  
  
Paul Buchheit adds:  
  
"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling‚Äîfounders take a small business that isn't really working (bad
unit economics, typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth numbers. This is similar to
over-hiring in that it makes the business much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really fast."

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html)

October 2006  
  
In the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made startups fail. After standing there gaping for a few
seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question. It's equivalent to asking how to make a startup succeed ‚Äî if you
avoid every cause of failure, you succeed ‚Äî and that's too big a question to answer on the fly.  
  
Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction. If you have a list of all the
things you shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by negating. And this form of list may be
more useful in practice. It's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't than always to remember to do
something you should. \[1\]   
  
In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users
want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if you don't make something users want, then you're
dead, whatever else you do or don't do. So really this is a list of 18 things that cause startups not to make something
users want. Nearly all failure funnels through that.

### **1. Single Founder**

Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person? Even companies you think of as having
one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.  
  
What's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder
couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the
ones who know him best.  
  
But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage. Starting a
startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with,
to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.  
  
The last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When
you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws. Each
thinks "I can't let my friends down." This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it's missing when
there's just one founder.

### **2. Bad Location**

Startups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and
New York. After that there's not much. Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it
is in Silicon Valley. In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.  
  
Why is the falloff so sharp? Probably for the same reason it is in other industries. What's the sixth largest fashion
center in the US? The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing? Whatever they are they're probably so far
from the top that it would be misleading even to call them centers.  
  
It's an interesting question why cities [become](http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html) startup hubs, but the
reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is for any industry: that's where the experts are. Standards
are higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind of people you want to hire want to live there;
supporting industries are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the same business. Who knows exactly
how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from
the number of startups per capita in each.

### **3. Marginal Niche**

Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope
of avoiding competition.  
  
If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a certain age they're afraid of the ball. When the ball
comes near them their instinct is to avoid it. I didn't make a lot of catches as an eight year old outfielder, because
whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of
catching it.  
  
Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing with fly balls. If you
make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by
avoiding good ideas.  
  
I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious. It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to
pursue smaller ones because they seem safer. Your unconscious won't even let you think of grand ideas. So the solution
may be to think about ideas without involving yourself. What would be a great idea for *someone else* to do as a
startup?

### **4. Derivative Idea**

Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company. That's one source of ideas, but not the best.
If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in imitation of some other startup. Where did they
get their ideas? Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.  
  
Our startup made software for making online stores. When we started it, there wasn't any; the few sites you could order
from were hand-made at great expense by web consultants. We knew that if online shopping ever took off, these sites
would have to be generated by software, so we wrote some. Pretty straightforward.  
  
It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak
wanted a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find stuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack
Smith couldn't exchange email at work.  
  
So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other
direction. Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems they solved, look for problems and
imagine the company that might solve them. \[2\] What do people complain about? What do you wish there was?

### **5. Obstinacy**

In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what
setbacks you encounter. Starting startups is not one of them. The stick-to-your-vision approach works for something like
winning an Olympic gold medal, where the problem is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to
follow the trail wherever it leads.  
  
So don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's probably wrong. Most successful startups end up doing
something different than they originally intended ‚Äî often so different that it doesn't even seem like the same company.
You have to be prepared to see the better idea when it arrives. And the hardest part of that is often discarding your
old idea.  
  
But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right. Switching to a new idea every week will be equally fatal. Is there
some kind of external test you can use? One is to ask whether the ideas represent some kind of progression. If in each
new idea you're able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then you're probably in a process that
converges. Whereas if you keep restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.  
  
Fortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users. If you're thinking about turning in some new direction
and your users seem excited about it, it's probably a good bet.

### **6. Hiring Bad Programmers**

I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list, because nearly all the founders I know are programmers. This
is not a serious problem for them. They might accidentally hire someone bad, but it's not going to kill the company. In
a pinch they can do whatever's required themselves.  
  
But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad
programmers. A lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had
some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it. That's actually much harder than it sounds ‚Äî almost
impossibly hard in fact ‚Äî because business guys can't tell which are the good programmers. They don't even get a shot at
the best ones, because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy.  
  
In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers (it says here on his
resume that he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren't. Then they're mystified to find that their startup
lumbers along like a World War II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters. This kind of startup is
in the same position as a big company, but without the advantages.  
  
So how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer? I don't think there's an answer. I was about to say
you'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people. But if you can't recognize good programmers, how would you
even do that?

### **7. Choosing the Wrong Platform**

A related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers) is choosing the wrong platform. For example, I think a
lot of startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build server-based applications on Windows. Hotmail
was still running on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because Windows couldn't handle the load.
If Hotmail's founders had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.  
  
PayPal only just dodged this bullet. After they merged with [X.com](http://X.com), the new CEO wanted to switch to
Windows ‚Äî even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on Windows as Unix.
Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.  
  
Platform is a vague word. It could mean an operating system, or a programming language, or a "framework" built on top of
a programming language. It implies something that both supports and limits, like the foundation of a house.  
  
The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and
yet, like Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them. Java applets were probably the most spectacular
example. This was supposed to be the new way of delivering applications. Presumably it killed just about 100% of the
startups who believed that.  
  
How do you pick the right platforms? The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them choose. But there is a trick
you could use if you're not a programmer: visit a top computer science department and see what they use in research
projects.

### **8. Slowness in Launching**

Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done. It's intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85%
done. It takes an effort of will to push through this and get something released to users. \[3\]  
  
Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch. Most are equivalent to the ones people use for
procrastinating in everyday life. There's something that needs to happen first. Maybe. But if the software were 100%
finished and ready to launch at the push of a button, would they still be waiting?  
  
One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually *finish* some quantum of work. Nothing is truly finished
till it's released; you can see that from the rush of work that's always involved in releasing anything, no matter how
finished you thought it was. The other reason you need to launch is that it's only by bouncing your idea off users that
you fully understand it.  
  
Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching: working too slowly; not truly understanding the
problem; fear of having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too many different things; excessive
perfectionism. Fortunately you can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch *something*
fairly quickly.

### **9. Launching Too Early**

Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to
launch too fast. The danger here is that you ruin your reputation. You launch something, the early adopters try it out,
and if it's no good they may never come back.  
  
So what's the minimum you need to launch? We suggest startups think about what they plan to do, identify a core that's
both (a) useful on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded into the whole project, and then get
that done as soon as possible.  
  
This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for writing software. Think about the overall goal, then
start by writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful. If it's a subset, you'll have to write it anyway,
so in the worst case you won't be wasting your time. But more likely you'll find that implementing a working subset is
both good for morale and helps you see more clearly what the rest should do.  
  
The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant. They don't expect a newly launched product to do everything;
it just has to do *something*.

### **10. Having No Specific User in Mind**

You can't build things users like without understanding them. I mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem
to have begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had. Perhaps there's a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in
proportion to how well you understand the problem you're solving, and the problems you understand best are your own.
\[4\]   
  
That's just a theory. What's not a theory is the converse: if you're trying to solve problems you don't understand,
you're hosed.  
  
And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone, they're not sure exactly who, will want
what they're building. Do the founders want it? No, they're not the target market. Who is? Teenagers. People interested
in local events (that one is a perennial tarpit). Or "business" users. What business users? Gas stations? Movie studios?
Defense contractors?  
  
You can of course build something for users other than yourself. We did. But you should realize you're stepping into
dangerous territory. You're flying on instruments, in effect, so you should (a) consciously shift gears, instead of
assuming you can rely on your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the instruments.  
  
In this case the instruments are the users. When designing for other people you have to be empirical. You can no longer
guess what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses. So if you're going to make something for
teenagers or "business" users or some other group that doesn't include you, you have to be able to talk some specific
ones into using what you're making. If you can't, you're on the wrong track.

### **11. Raising Too Little Money**

Most successful startups take funding at some point. Like having more than one founder, it seems a good bet
statistically. How much should you take, though?  
  
Startup funding is measured in time. Every startup that isn't profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a
certain amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop. This is sometimes referred to as runway, as
in "How much runway do you have left?" It's a good metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you're
going to be airborne or dead.  
  
Too little money means not enough to get airborne. What airborne means depends on the situation. Usually you have to
advance to a visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype; if you have a prototype, launching;
if you're launched, significant growth. It depends on investors, because until you're profitable that's who you have to
convince.  
  
So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get to the next step, whatever that is. \[5\]
Fortunately you have some control over both how much you spend and what the next step is. We advise startups to set both
low, initially: spend practically nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype. This gives you
maximum flexibility.

### **12. Spending Too Much**

It's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little. If you run out of money, you could say either was
the cause. The only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other startups. If you raised five million and
ran out of money, you probably spent too much.  
  
Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be. Founders seem to have learned that lesson. Plus it
keeps getting cheaper to start a startup. So as of this writing few startups spend too much. None of the ones we've
funded have. (And not just because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further rounds.)  
  
The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your
costs, it slows you down‚Äîso money that's getting consumed faster has to last longer. Most hackers understand why that
happens; Fred Brooks explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.  
  
We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don't do it if you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather
than salary, not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who are committed enough to prefer that,
and (c) only hire people who are either going to write code or go out and get users, because those are the only things
you need at first.

### **13. Raising Too Much Money**

It's obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such a thing as having too much?  
  
Yes and no. The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it. As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said,
"Once you take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking." If VCs fund you, they're not going to let you
just put the money in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen. They want that money to go to work. \[6\]
At the very least you'll move into proper office space and hire more people. That will change the atmosphere, and not
entirely for the better. Now most of your people will be employees rather than founders. They won't be as committed;
they'll need to be told what to do; they'll start to engage in office politics.  
  
When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs and has kids.  
  
Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets harder to change direction. Suppose your initial plan was
to sell something to companies. After taking VC money you hire a sales force to do that. What happens now if you realize
you should be making this for consumers instead of businesses? That's a completely different kind of selling. What
happens, in practice, is that you don't realize that. The more people you have, the more you stay pointed in the same
direction.  
  
Another drawback of large investments is the time they take. The time required to raise money grows with the amount.
\[7\] When the amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious. VCs never quite say yes or no; they just
engage you in an apparently endless conversation. Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge time sink ‚Äî more work,
probably, than the startup itself. And you don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your
competitors are spending theirs building things.  
  
We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first reasonable deal they get. If you get an offer from a
reputable firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms, just take it and get on with building the
company. \[8\] Who cares if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere? Economically, startups are an all-or-nothing
game. Bargain-hunting among investors is a waste of time.

### **14. Poor Investor Management**

As a founder, you have to manage your investors. You shouldn't ignore them, because they may have useful insights. But
neither should you let them run the company. That's supposed to be your job. If investors had sufficient vision to run
the companies they fund, why didn't they start them?  
  
Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them. In our startup, we erred on
the ignoring side. A lot of our energy got drained away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.
But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have destroyed the company. If the founders know what
they're doing, it's better to have half their attention focused on the product than the full attention of investors who
don't.  
  
How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on how much money you've taken. When you raise VC-scale
money, the investors get a great deal of control. If they have a board majority, they're literally your bosses. In the
more common case, where founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside
directors, all the investors have to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.  
  
If things go well, this shouldn't matter. So long as you seem to be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you
alone. But things don't always go smoothly in startups. Investors have made trouble even for the most successful
companies. One of the most famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder in firing Steve Jobs.
Apparently even Google got a lot of grief from their investors early on.

### **15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit**

When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want, you'll be fine, you may have noticed I didn't
mention anything about having the right business model. That's not because making money is unimportant. I'm not
suggesting that founders start companies with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before they tank.
The reason we tell founders not to worry about the business model initially is that making something people want is so
much harder.  
  
I don't know why it's so hard to make something people want. It seems like it should be straightforward. But you can
tell it must be hard by how few startups do it.  
  
Because making something people want is so much harder than making money from it, you should leave business models for
later, just as you'd leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2. In version 1, solve the core problem. And the
core problem in a startup is how to [create wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) (= how much people want
something x the number who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.  
  
The companies that win are the ones that put users first. Google, for example. They made search work, then worried about
how to make money from it. And yet some startup founders still think it's irresponsible not to focus on the business
model from the beginning. They're often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes from less malleable
industries.  
  
It *is* irresponsible not to think about business models. It's just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the
product.

### **16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty**

Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code and have someone else handle the messy business of
extracting money from it. And not just the lazy ones. Larry and Sergey apparently felt this way too at first. After
developing their new search algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company to buy it.  
  
Start a company? Yech. Most hackers would rather just have ideas. But as Larry and Sergey found, there's not much of a
market for ideas. No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and use that to grow a user base. Then they'll
pay big time.  
  
Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much. There's nothing like users for convincing acquirers. It's not
just that the risk is decreased. The acquirers are human, and they have a hard time paying a bunch of young guys
millions of dollars just for being clever. When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot of users, they can tell
themselves they're buying the users rather than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow. \[9\]   
  
If you're going to attract users, you'll probably have to get up from your computer and go find some. It's unpleasant
work, but if you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of succeeding. In the first batch of startups we
funded, in the summer of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their applications. But there was one
who was away half the time talking to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals. Can you imagine
anything more painful for a hacker? \[10\] But it paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that group
by an order of magnitude.  
  
If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you can't just hack. At least one hacker will have to
spend some of the time doing business stuff.

### **17. Fights Between Founders**

Fights between founders are surprisingly common. About 20% of the startups we've funded have had a founder leave. It
happens so often that we've reversed our attitude to vesting. We still don't require it, but now we advise founders to
vest so there will be an orderly way for people to quit.  
  
A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though. Plenty of successful startups have had that happen. \[11\]
Fortunately it's usually the least committed founder who leaves. If there are three founders and one who was lukewarm
leaves, big deal. If you have two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves, that's more of a
problem. But even that is survivable. Blogger got down to one person, and they bounced back.  
  
Most of the disputes I've seen between founders could have been avoided if they'd been more careful about who they
started a company with. Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people. Which means they're inevitable. And
most founders who've been burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed, when they started the
company. Don't suppress misgivings. It's much easier to fix problems before the company is started than after. So don't
include your housemate in your startup because he'd feel left out otherwise. Don't start a company with someone you
dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you won't find anyone else. The people are the most
important ingredient in a startup, so don't compromise there.

### **18. A Half-Hearted Effort**

The failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular flameouts. Those are actually the elite of failures. The
most common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the one that doesn't do much of anything ‚Äî the one
we never even hear about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the side while working on their day jobs,
but which never got anywhere and was gradually abandoned.  
  
Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the most important thing is to quit your day job. Most
founders of failed startups don't quit their day jobs, and most founders of successful ones do. If startup failure were
a disease, the CDC would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.  
  
Does that mean you should quit your day job? Not necessarily. I'm guessing here, but I'd guess that many of these
would-be founders may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company, and that in the back of their
minds, they know it. The reason they don't invest more time in their startup is that they know it's a bad investment.
\[12\]  
  
I'd also guess there's some band of people who could have succeeded if they'd taken the leap and done it full-time, but
didn't. I have no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless progression has the sort of
distribution you'd expect, the number of people who could have made it, if they'd quit their day job, is probably an
order of magnitude larger than the number who do make it. \[13\]  
  
If that's true, most startups that could succeed fail because the founders don't devote their whole efforts to them.
That certainly accords with what I see out in the world. Most startups fail because they don't make something people
want, and the reason most don't is that they don't try hard enough.  
  
In other words, starting startups is just like everything else. The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard
enough. To the extent there's a secret to success, it's not to be in denial about that.

### **Notes**

\[1\] This is not a complete list of the causes of failure, just those you can control. There are also several you
can't, notably ineptitude and bad luck.  
  
\[2\] Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a facebook exclusively for college students.  
  
\[3\] Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying "Real artists ship." This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not
true. Many famous works of art are unfinished. It's true in fields that have hard deadlines, like architecture and
filmmaking, but even there people tend to be tweaking stuff till it's yanked out of their hands.  
  
\[4\] There's probably also a second factor: startup founders tend to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems
they face are probably especially valuable.  
  
\[5\] You should take more than you think you'll need, maybe 50% to 100% more, because software takes longer to write
and deals longer to close than you expect.  
  
\[6\] Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we're not. VCs invest large amounts of other people's money.
We invest small amounts of our own, like angel investors.  
  
\[7\] Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five million dollars. In practice it just feels like it
takes forever.  
  
Though if you include the cases where VCs don't invest, it would literally take forever in the median case. And maybe we
should, because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that they take a long time. That's the *best* case.
The real danger is that you'll expend a lot of time and get nothing.  
  
\[8\] Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see if you have the balls to ask for more. It's lame that
VCs play such games, but some do. If you're dealing with one of those you should push back on the valuation a bit.  
  
\[9\] Suppose YouTube's founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told them "Google Video is badly designed. Give us $10
million and we'll tell you all the mistakes you made." They would have gotten the royal raspberry. Eighteen months later
Google paid $1.6 billion for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves that they were buying a
phenomenon, or a community, or some vague thing like that.  
  
I don't mean to be hard on Google. They did better than their competitors, who may have now missed the video boat
entirely.  
  
\[10\] Yes, actually: dealing with the government. But phone companies are up there.  
  
\[11\] Many more than most people realize, because companies don't advertise this. Did you know Apple originally had
three founders?  
  
\[12\] I'm not dissing these people. I don't have the determination myself. I've twice come close to starting startups
since Viaweb, and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur of poverty I just wasn't willing to
endure the stress of a startup.  
  
\[13\] So how do you know whether you're in the category of people who should quit their day job, or the presumably
larger one who shouldn't? I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge for yourself and that you should seek
outside advice, before realizing that that's what we do. We think of ourselves as investors, but viewed from the other
direction Y Combinator is a service for advising people whether or not to quit their day job. We could be mistaken, and
no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on our conclusions.

September 2012  
  
A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it
necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential
thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.  
  
If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the
side and hope to succeed. You have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth,
everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost every decision
you face.

### **Redwoods**

Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often overlooked: not every newly founded company is a
startup. Millions of companies are started every year in the US. Only a tiny fraction are startups. Most are service
businesses ‚Äî restaurants, barbershops, plumbers, and so on. These are not startups, except in a few unusual cases. A
barbershop isn't designed to grow fast. Whereas a search engine, for example, is.  
  
When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two senses. Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended,
because most startups fail. But I also mean startups are different by nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a
different destiny from a bean sprout.  
  
That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for companies designed to grow fast. If all companies were
essentially similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need
a separate word. We could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful ones. But in fact startups do
have a different sort of DNA from other businesses. Google is not just a barbershop whose founders were unusually lucky
and hard-working. Google was different from the beginning.  
  
To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big market. That's the difference between Google and a
barbershop. A barbershop doesn't scale.  
  
For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those
people. Barbershops are doing fine in the (a) department. Almost everyone needs their hair cut. The problem for a
barbershop, as for any retail establishment, is (b). A barbershop serves customers in person, and few will travel far
for a haircut. And even if they did, the barbershop couldn't accomodate them. \[1\]  
  
Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end up constrained in (a). If you write software to
teach Tibetan to Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who want it, but there won't be many of
them. If you make software to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup territory.  
  
Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b). The distinctive feature of successful startups is that they're
not.

### **Ideas**

It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup than an ordinary business. If you're going to start a
company, why not start the type with the most potential? The catch is that this is a (fairly) efficient market. If you
write software to teach Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition. If you write software to teach English
to Chinese speakers, you'll face ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize. \[2\]   
  
The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them. That's the tradeoff. If you start a barbershop, you
only have to compete with other local barbers. If you start a search engine you have to compete with the whole world.  
  
The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business protect it from is not competition, however, but the
difficulty of coming up with new ideas. If you open a bar in a particular neighborhood, as well as limiting your
potential and protecting you from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your company. Bar +
neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small business. Similarly for companies constrained in (a). Your niche both
protects and defines you.  
  
Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to have to think of something fairly novel. A startup has
to make something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are
already taken.  
  
That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup generally has to work on something everyone else
has overlooked. I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to find ideas everyone else has overlooked.
But that's not how most startups get started. Usually successful startups happen because the founders are sufficiently
different from other people that ideas few others can see seem obvious to them. Perhaps later they step back and notice
they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot, and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. \[3\]
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the innovation is unconscious.  
  
What's different about successful founders is that they can see different problems. It's a particularly good combination
both to be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by it, because technology changes so rapidly that
formerly bad ideas often become good without anyone noticing. Steve Wozniak's problem was that he wanted his own
computer. That was an unusual problem to have in 1975. But technological change was about to make it a much more common
one. Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one. And the
problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for millions of people in the coming years. But by the time
it was obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was already established.  
  
Google has similar origins. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to search the web. But unlike most people they had the
technical expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as good as they could be, and to know how to
improve them. Over the next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web grew to a size where you
didn't have to be a picky search expert to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough. But as happened with Apple, by
the time everyone else realized how important search was, Google was entrenched.  
  
That's one connection between startup ideas and technology. Rapid change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in
other areas. Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility. That was the kind of change that
yielded Apple; advances in chip technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could afford. But in Google's
case the most important change was the growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.  
  
The other connection between startups and technology is that startups create new ways of doing things, and new ways of
doing things are, in the broader sense of the word, new technology. When a startup both begins with an idea exposed by
technological change and makes a product consisting of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high
technology"), it's easy to conflate the two. But the two connections are distinct and in principle one could start a
startup that was neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted of technology except in the broader
sense. \[4\]

### **Rate**

How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup? There's no precise answer to that. "Startup" is a pole,
not a threshold. Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of one's ambitions. You're committing not just to
starting a company, but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to search for one of the rare ideas
of that type. But at first you have no more than commitment. Starting a startup is like being an actor in that respect.
"Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold. At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions. Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't only become an actor when he's successful.  
  
So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to
have. For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's equivalent to asking if they're on the right
path.  
  
The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:

1.  There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing.
2.  As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period
    of rapid growth.
3.  Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and
    partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves. \[5\]

Together these three phases produce an S-curve. The phase whose growth defines the startup is the second one, the
ascent. Its length and slope determine how big the company will be.  
  
The slope is the company's growth rate. If there's one number every founder should always know, it's the company's
growth rate. That's the measure of a startup. If you don't know that number, you don't even know if you're doing well or
badly.  
  
When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is, sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new
customers a month." That's not a rate. What matters is not the absolute number of new customers, but the ratio of new
customers to existing ones. If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every month, you're in trouble,
because that means your growth rate is decreasing.  
  
During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly
because startups early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what they're doing. \[6\]  
  
A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. If you can only
manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.  
  
The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is
active users. That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the startup does start trying to make money,
their revenues will probably be a constant multiple of active users. \[7\]

### **Compass**

We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they can hit, and then just try to hit it every week. The
key word here is "just." If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that number, they're successful for that week.
There's nothing more they need to do. But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the only thing that mattered, and
should be correspondingly alarmed.  
  
Programmers will recognize what we're doing here. We're turning starting a startup into an optimization problem. And
anyone who has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort of narrow focus can be. Optimizing code
means taking an existing program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or memory. You don't have to
think about what the program should do, just make it faster. For most programmers this is very satisfying work. The
narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're generally surprised how fast you can solve it.  
  
Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly multifarious problem of starting a startup to a
single problem. You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for you; anything that gets you the
growth you need is ipso facto right. Should you spend two days at a conference? Should you hire another programmer?
Should you focus more on marketing? Should you spend time courting some big customer? Should you add x feature? Whatever
gets you your target growth rate. \[8\]  
  
Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more than a week ahead. Once you experience the pain of
missing your target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed at it), you become interested in
anything that could spare you such pain in the future. So you'll be willing for example to hire another programmer, who
won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users. But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and
(b) you're sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers without hiring someone new.  
  
It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think about it no more than necessary.  
  
In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into trouble. They could end up on a local maximum. But in
practice that never happens. Having to hit a growth number every week forces founders to act, and acting versus not
acting is the high bit of succeeding. Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is just a form of
procrastination. Whereas founders' intuitions about which hill to climb are usually better than they realize. Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better
ones.  
  
The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can actually discover startup ideas. You can use the need
for growth as a form of evolutionary pressure. If you start out with some initial plan and modify it as necessary to
keep hitting, say, 10% weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than you meant to start. But
anything that grows consistently at 10% a week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.  
  
There's a parallel here to small businesses. Just as the constraint of being located in a particular neighborhood helps
define a bar, the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a startup.  
  
You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads rather than being influenced by some initial
vision, just as a scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather than being influenced by what he
wishes were the case. When Richard Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the imagination of man,
he meant that if you just keep following the truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made up. For
startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every successful startup is at least partly a product of the
imagination of growth. \[9\]

### **Value**

It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several percent a week, but if you do you may have found
something surprisingly valuable. If we project forward we see why.

![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/462381/5736f09c-fb11-40af-ba02-8f3f3c0810c3&type=article&id=550)

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x. A
company making $1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a week will 4 years later be making $7900
a month, which is less than a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley. A startup that grows at 5% a week will
in 4 years be making $25 million a month. \[10\]  
  
Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential growth, because our intuitions are no guide here. What
happens to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.  
  
Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different outcomes. That's why there's a separate word for
startups, and why startups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money and getting acquired. And,
strangely enough, it's also why they fail so frequently.  
  
Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone familiar with the concept of expected value would be
surprised if the failure rate weren't high. If a successful startup could make a founder $100 million, then even if the
chance of succeeding were only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million. And the probability of a
group of sufficiently smart and determined founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%. For the
right people ‚Äî e.g. the young Bill Gates ‚Äî the probability might be 20% or even 50%. So it's not surprising that so many
want to take a shot at it. In an efficient market, the number of failed startups should be proportionate to the size of
the successes. And since the latter is huge the former should be too. \[11\]  
  
What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of startups will be working on something that's never
going to go anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose title of "startup."  
  
This doesn't bother me. It's the same with other high-beta vocations, like being an actor or a novelist. I've long since
gotten used to it. But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those who've started ordinary businesses. Many
are annoyed that these so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them will amount to anything.  
  
If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be less indignant. The mistake they're making is that by
basing their opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the median rather than the average. If you
judge by the median startup, the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud. You have to invent a bubble to explain
why founders want to start them or investors want to fund them. But it's a mistake to use the median in a domain with so
much variation. If you look at the average outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors like them,
and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational choice for founders to start them.

### **Deals**

Why do investors like startups so much? Why are they so hot to invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid
money-making businesses? Not only for the obvious reason.  
  
The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk. Startups pass that test because although they're appallingly
risky, the returns when they do succeed are so high. But that's not the only reason investors like startups. An ordinary
slower-growing business might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were lower. So why are VCs interested
only in high-growth companies? The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back, ideally after the startup
IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.  
  
The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of dividends. Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that
invests in ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits? Because it's too easy for people who control
a private company to funnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced components from a supplier they
control) while making it look like the company is making little profit. Anyone who invested in private companies in
return for dividends would have to pay close attention to their books.  
  
The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns, but also because such investments are so easy to
oversee. The founders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors. \[12\]  
  
Why do founders want to take the VCs' money? Growth, again. The constraint between good ideas and growth operates in
both directions. It's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow. If you have such an idea and don't grow fast
enough, competitors will. Growing too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network effects, which the
best startups usually have to some degree.  
  
Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started. But startups often raise money even when they are or
could be profitable. It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable company for less than you think it will later
be worth, but it's no more foolish than buying insurance. Fundamentally that's how the most successful startups view
fundraising. They could grow the company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied by VCs will let them
grow even faster. Raising money lets you *choose* your growth rate.  
  
Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful startups, because the VCs need them more than they
need the VCs. A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues. Growing slower might be slightly
dangerous, but chances are it wouldn't kill them. Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and in particular the most
successful startups, or they'll be out of business. Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will be offered
money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse. And yet because of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can
still make money from such investments. You'd have to be crazy to believe your company was going to become as valuable
as a high growth rate can make it, but some do.  
  
Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers too. Why? What is it about startups that makes other
companies want to buy them? \[13\]  
  
Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock of successful startups: a rapidly growing company
is valuable. It's a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now responsible for 43% of their sales
and probably more of their growth.  
  
But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups. A rapidly growing company is not merely valuable, but
dangerous. If it keeps expanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory. Most product acquisitions have some
component of fear. Even if an acquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be alarmed at the thought of
what a competitor could do with it. And because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers, acquirers will
often pay more than an ordinary investor would. \[14\]

### **Understand**

The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural ecosystem. It works so well that those who don't
understand it are driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things sometimes turn out. Just as our
ancestors did to explain the apparently too neat workings of the natural world. But there is no secret cabal making it
all work.  
  
If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark
Zuckerberg to buy it. To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductio ad absurdum of the initial assumption.
The reason he bought Instagram was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was growth.  
  
If you want to understand startups, understand growth. Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups
usually work on technology ‚Äî because ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is
to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it's
a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so
valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not
just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't
need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get
acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too.  
  
It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have to understand the forces driving it. Understanding
growth is what starting a startup *consists* of. What you're really doing (and to the dismay of some observers, all
you're really doing) when you start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem than ordinary businesses
do. You're committing to search for one of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth. Because these ideas are so
valuable, finding one is hard. The startup is the embodiment of your discoveries so far. Starting a startup is thus very
much like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to solve any specific problem; you don't know for
sure which problems are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no one knew before. A startup
founder is in effect an economic research scientist. Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some discover
relativity.

### **Notes**

\[1\] Strictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big market, meaning a high product of number of
customers times how much they'll pay. But it's dangerous to have too few customers even if they pay a lot, or the power
that individual customers have over you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm. So whatever market you're in,
you'll usually do best to err on the side of making the broadest type of product for it.  
  
\[2\] One year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged programmers who wanted to start businesses to use a
restaurant as a model. What he meant, I believe, is that it's fine to start software companies constrained in (a) in the
same way a restaurant is constrained in (b). I agree. Most people should not try to start startups.  
  
\[3\] That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at Y Combinator. It's common for founders to have
discovered something intuitively without understanding all its implications. That's probably true of the biggest
discoveries in any field.  
  
\[4\] I got it wrong in ["How to Make Wealth"](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) when I said that a startup was a
small company that takes on a hard technical problem. That is the most common recipe but not the only one.  
  
\[5\] In principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets they serve, because they could just expand into
new markets. But there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that. Which means the slowdown that comes
from bumping up against the limits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which internal limits are
expressed.  
  
It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing the shape of the organization ‚Äî specifically by
sharding it.  
  
\[6\] This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched or can launch during YC. A startup building a new
database will probably not do that. On the other hand, launching something small and then using growth rate as
evolutionary pressure is such a valuable technique that any company that could start this way probably should.  
  
\[7\] If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building something they hope will be very popular but from
which they don't yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be higher, even though it's a proxy for
revenue growth, because such companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.  
  
Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the churn is high as well, so that you have good net
growth till you run through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.  
  
\[8\] Within YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets you growth, it's implicit that this excludes
trickery like buying users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active when they're really not,
bleeding out invites at a regularly increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc. Even if you were able to
fool investors with such tricks, you'd ultimately be hurting yourself, because you're throwing off your own compass.  
  
\[9\] Which is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that successful startups are simply the embodiment of some
brilliant initial idea. What you're looking for initially is not so much a great idea as an idea that could evolve into
a great one. The danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of great ones. They're often different in
kind, because the early adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the rest of the market. For example,
the idea that evolves into Facebook isn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into Facebook is a site for
Harvard undergrads.  
  
\[10\] What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time? Could it not grow just as big as any successful
startup? In principle yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month grew at 1% a week for 19 years,
it would grow as big as a company growing at 5% a week for 4 years. But while such trajectories may be common in, say,
real estate development, you don't see them much in the technology business. In technology, companies that grow slowly
tend not to grow as big.  
  
\[11\] Any expected value calculation varies from person to person depending on their utility function for money. I.e.
the first million is worth more to most people than subsequent millions. How much more depends on the person. For
founders who are younger or more ambitious the utility function is flatter. Which is probably part of the reason the
founders of the most successful startups of all tend to be on the young side.  
  
\[12\] More precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which is where all the returns come from. A startup
founder could pull the same trick of enriching himself at the company's expense by selling them overpriced components.
But it wouldn't be worth it for the founders of Google to do that. Only founders of failing startups would even be
tempted, but those are writeoffs from the VCs' point of view anyway.  
  
\[13\] Acquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer wants the business, and those where the acquirer
just wants the employees. The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition. Though nominally acquisitions and
sometimes on a scale that has a significant effect on the expected value calculation for potential founders, HR
acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to hiring bonuses.  
  
\[14\] I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived from Russia. They found it novel that if you
threatened a company they'd pay a premium for you. "In Russia they just kill you," they said, and they were only partly
joking. Economically, the fact that established companies can't simply eliminate new competitors may be one of the most
valuable aspects of the rule of law. And so to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via regulations or
patent suits, we should worry, not because it's a departure from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law is
aiming at.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html)

October 2014  
  
(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's [startup class](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/) at
Stanford. It's intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)  
  
One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my
own kids?" My kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups if they were in college, and that's
what I'm going to tell you.  
  
Startups are very counterintuitive. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our
culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.  
  
It's like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. But if
you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that
impulse. Eventually you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort. At first there's a list of things
you're trying to remember as you start down the hill.  
  
Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part
of it ‚Äî the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.

### **Counterintuitive**

The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts,
you'll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.  
  
When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. It's
really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders
ignore them, and then come back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."  
  
Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice? Well, that's the thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict
your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to disregard them. And in fact my joking
description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts already gave
them the right answers, they wouldn't need us. You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors. \[1\]  
  
You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is
not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings
personally. Later when things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he
seemed so impressive."  
  
If you're thinking about getting involved with someone ‚Äî as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer ‚Äî and
you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.  
  
This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough
to be sure.

### **Expertise**

The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important to know a lot about startups. The way to succeed in a
startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at
startups, because he understood his users really well.  
  
If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don't feel bad on that account. That sort of thing
you can learn when you need to, and forget after you've done it.  
  
In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly
somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid)
class FF stock, I wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers." It would set off alarms. Because
another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make
up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the
outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is:
gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have
neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.

### **Game**

We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening.
The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do
for their whole lives up to that point. Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example.
Extracurricular activities, check. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.  
  
I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the
work you do when you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance it's inevitable that people will
exploit the difference to the point where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.  
  
I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the
right shape to make good exam questions. The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to
master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in
advance. When I walked into the final, the main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would
turn up on the exam. It was like a game.  
  
It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first impulse on
starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. Since fundraising appears to be the
measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for
convincing investors. We tell them the best way to [convince investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html) is to
make a startup that's actually doing well, meaning [growing fast](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html), and then
simply tell investors so. Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. And we have to tell them the best
way to do that is simply to make something people want.  
  
So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the
partner replying "Just..."  
  
Why do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.  
  
So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system
stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the
company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. \[2\]
But that doesn't work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your
product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you
prosper only to the extent you do.  
  
The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you're super good at sounding like you know
what you're talking about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two rounds of funding. But it's not
in your interest to. The company is ultimately doomed. All you're doing is wasting your own time riding it down.  
  
So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of
magnitude less important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made
something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat
usage graph. And more importantly, the founder who has made something users love is the one who will go on to succeed
after raising the money.  
  
Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that
gaming the system stops working when you start a startup. It's exciting that there even exist parts of the world where
you win by doing good work. Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies,
where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do. \[3\] I would have been
delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than
others, and a few where it hardly mattered at all. But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things
to consider when you're thinking about your future. How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win
by doing? \[4\]

### **All-Consuming**

That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming. If you start a startup, it will take
over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long
time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a
real opportunity cost here.  
  
Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable. Basically at 25 he
started running as fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to catch his breath since. Every day
new shit happens in the Google empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. If he goes
on vacation for even a week, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates. And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly
because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero
sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives. Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a
successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.  
  
Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders
say the same thing. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. You're worrying about construction
delays at your London office instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment. But the total volume of
worry never decreases; if anything it increases.  
  
Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button you push that changes your life
irrevocably. And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have
them than after. Many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And since you can delay pushing the
button for a while, most people in rich countries do.  
  
Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're supposed to start them while they're still in
college. Are you crazy? And what are the universities thinking? They go out of their way to ensure their students are
well supplied with contraceptives, and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and
right.  
  
To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming students are interested in startups.
Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers. So students who want to start startups
hope universities can teach them about startups. And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to
claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.  
  
Can universities teach students about startups? Yes and no. They can teach students about startups, but as I explained
before, this is not what you need to know. What you need to learn about are the needs of your own users, and you can't
do that until you actually start the company. \[5\] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really
learn by doing it. And it's impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your
life. You can't start a startup for real as a student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even be that for long. \[6\]   
  
Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take? Be a real student and not start a startup, or start a real
startup and not be a student? I can answer that one for you. Do not start a startup in college. How to start a startup
is just a subset of a bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life. And though starting a startup can
be part of a good life for a lot of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it. Starting a startup is
like a brutally fast depth-first search. Most people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.  
  
You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a
whim and travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline. For unambitious people, this sort of thing is the dreaded
"failure to launch," but for the ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration. If you start a
startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful, you'll never get to do it. \[7\]   
  
Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. He can do other things most people can't, like charter
jets to fly him to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity out of his life. Facebook is
running him as much as he's running Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider
your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. Among other things it gives you
more options to choose your life's work from.  
  
There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're
more likely to succeed if you wait. In the unlikely case that you're 20 and one of your side projects takes off like
Facebook did, you'll face a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run with it. But the usual way
startups take off is for the founders to [make them](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.

### **Try**

Should you do it at any age? I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven't, let me try again: starting a
startup is really hard. What if it's too hard? How can you tell if you're up to this challenge?  
  
The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your
prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. But unless you've had a
very strange life you haven't done much that was [like](http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html) being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could
grow into, and who can do that?  
  
For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. It
was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold. The hard part was
predicting how tough and ambitious they would become. There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict
that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much. I learned to keep a
completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.  
  
The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every
one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far. Others arrive wondering how they got in, and
hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them. But there is little correlation between founders'
initial attitudes and how well their companies do.  
  
I've read that the same is true in the military ‚Äî that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be
really tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the
ones in their previous lives.  
  
If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether
you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

### **Ideas**

So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two things you need initially:
an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive
point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.  
  
I've written a whole [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) on this, so I won't repeat it all here. But
the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not
merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're
bad.  
  
The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of
startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so
unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.  
  
This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. None of these companies were
even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. The best startups almost have to start as side
projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for
companies.  
  
Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things
that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part,
incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.  
  
The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about things that matter," I wrote "become good at some
technology." But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia
was not that they were experts in technology. They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were
good at organizing groups and making projects happen. So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you
work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.  
  
What kind of problems are those? That is very hard to answer in the general case. History is full of examples of young
people who were working on important problems that [no one else](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html) at the time
thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn't think were important. On the other hand, history is
even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right. So how do you know
when you're working on real stuff? \[8\]  
  
I know how *I* know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on
interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find
it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be important.  
  
My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed interesting, and it turned out
later to be useful in some worldly way. [Y Combinator itself](http://ycombinator.com/start.html) was something I only
did because it seemed interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. But I don't know
what other people have in their heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing
genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself
for a startup. And indeed, probably also the best way to live. \[9\]  
  
But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large
subset of them. If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving
point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good
startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology ‚Äî to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to
"live in the future." When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you. You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.  
  
For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice
over IP software. He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to
his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed
obvious to him that the way to do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did any
more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get started.  
  
So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort
of new, vocational version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic version of college as education
for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things.
And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own
inclinations. \[10\]  
  
The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an
expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior
motive.  
  
At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the
ulterior motive toward the end of the process.  
  
So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.

### **Notes**

\[1\] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a [predictor of
success](http://www.paulgraham.com/word.html). One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently
they listened.  
  
\[2\] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. If big companies weren't plagued by internal
inefficiencies, they'd be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.  
  
\[3\] In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on [schleps](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html), but this sort of
work is merely unglamorous, not bogus.  
  
\[4\] What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system? Management consulting.  
  
\[5\] The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get significant numbers of users, you've started it,
whether you realize it yet or not.  
  
\[6\] It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach students how to be good startup founders, because they
can't teach them how to be good employees either.  
  
The way universities "teach" students how to be employees is to hand off the task to companies via internship programs.
But you couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never
come back.  
  
\[7\] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. It was only
because he was otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he could accept it. And yet if he hadn't
we probably would not know his name.  
  
\[8\] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department. There are some whose definition of important
problems includes only those on the critical path to med school.  
  
\[9\] I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you
find known boring ideas intolerable. Could you endure studying literary theory, or working in middle management at a
large company?  
  
\[10\] In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education
than past generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a
little about how the courses they took might look to an employer. And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from
taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA. Good news: users [don't
care](http://www.paulgraham.com/credentials.html) what your GPA was. And I've never heard of investors caring either. Y
Combinator certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades you got in them.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html)

March 2007  
  
(This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)  
  
We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data about success rates. Our first batch, in the summer
of 2005, had eight startups in it. Of those eight, it now looks as if at least four succeeded. Three have been acquired:
[Reddit](http://reddit.com/) was a merger of two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't talk about
yet. Another from that batch was [Loopt](http://loopt.com/), which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in
about ten minutes if they wanted to.  
  
So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.
(One thing you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)  
  
I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have been an anomaly. But we
should be able to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made up) standard figure of 10%. I'd feel safe aiming
at 25%.  
  
Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time. Of those first eight startups, three are now probably
dead. In two cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of the summer. I don't think they were
traumatized by the experience. The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept working on their startup
for a whole year before being squashed by Google Calendar. But they ended up happy. They sold their software on eBay for
a quarter of a million dollars. After they paid back their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each. \[1\]
Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting startup, [Justin.TV](http://Justin.TV).  
  
So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch had a terrible experience. They had ups and downs,
like every startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a cubicle. And that statistic is probably
not an anomaly. Whatever our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people who wish they'd gotten a
regular job will stay close to 0%.  
  
The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups? If nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular
job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do this? A lot of people think we get thousands
of applications for each funding cycle. In fact we usually only get several hundred. Why don't more people apply? And
while it must seem to anyone watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the number is small compared
to the number of people with the necessary skills. The great majority of programmers still go straight from college to
cubicle, and stay there.  
  
It seems like people are not acting in their own interest. What's going on? Well, I can answer that. Because of Y
Combinator's position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're probably the world's leading experts on
the psychology of people who aren't sure if they want to start a company.  
  
There's nothing wrong with being unsure. If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup and hesitating before
taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition. Larry and Sergey seem to have felt the same before they started
Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started Yahoo. In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the
ones started by uncertain hackers rather than gung-ho business guys.  
  
We have some evidence to support this. Several of the most successful startups we've funded told us later that they only
decided to apply at the last moment. Some decided only hours before the deadline.  
  
The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are reluctant to do something have
about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know themselves which are biggest. Some will be
justified and some bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you don't know whether your overall
uncertainty is mostly justified or mostly bogus.  
  
So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to start startups, and explain which are real. Then
would-be founders can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.  
  
I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence. But there are two things different here from the usual
confidence-building exercise. One is that I'm motivated to be honest. Most people in the confidence-building business
have already achieved their goal when you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you how great you
are. Whereas if I encourage people to start startups who shouldn't, I make my own life worse. If I encourage too many
people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me, because I have to read all the applications.  
  
The other thing that's going to be different is my approach. Instead of being positive, I'm going to be negative.
Instead of telling you "come on, you can do it" I'm going to consider all the reasons you aren't doing it, and show why
most (but not all) should be ignored. We'll start with the one everyone's born with.

### **1. Too young**

A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27, so
probably a third of the population can truthfully say they're too young.  
  
What's too young? One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover the lower bound on the age of startup founders. It
always seemed to us that investors were too conservative here‚Äîthat they wanted to fund professors, when really they
should be funding grad students or even undergrads.  
  
The main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.
The outer limit may be as low as 16. We don't look beyond 18 because people younger than that can't legally enter into
contracts. But the most successful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the time.  
  
Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point. When he was 19, he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him. There
are other 19 year olds who are 12 inside.  
  
There's a reason we have a distinct word "adult" for people over a certain age. There is a threshold you cross. It's
conventionally fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages. You're old enough to start a startup
if you've crossed this threshold, whatever your age.  
  
How do you tell? There are a couple tests adults use. I realized these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.
I noticed that I felt like I was talking to someone much older. Afterward I wondered, what am I even measuring? What
made him seem older?  
  
One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex. When you're a little kid and you're asked to do
something hard, you can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably let you off. As a kid there's a magic
button you can press by saying "I'm just a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations. Whereas adults, by
definition, are not allowed to flake. They still do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.  
  
The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge. Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond
to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance. If an adult says "that's a stupid idea," a kid
will either crawl away with his tail between his legs, or rebel. But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as
submission. The adult response to "that's a stupid idea," is simply to look the other person in the eye and say "Really?
Why do you think so?"  
  
There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges, of course. What you don't often find are kids who
react to challenges like adults. When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their age.

### **2. Too inexperienced**

I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that people should work for another company for a few
years before starting their own. I no longer believe that, and what changed my mind is the example of the startups we've
funded.  
  
I still think 23 is a better age than 21. But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a startup. So,
paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is start one. That's a way more
efficient cure for inexperience than a normal job. In fact, getting a normal job may actually make you less able to
start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to
tell him what software to write.  
  
What really convinced me of this was the Kikos. They started a startup right out of college. Their inexperience caused
them to make a lot of mistakes. But by the time we funded their second startup, a year later, they had become extremely
formidable. They were certainly not tame animals. And there is no way they'd have grown so much if they'd spent that
year working at Microsoft, or even Google. They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.  
  
So now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out of college. There's no better time to take risks than
when you're young. Sure, you'll probably fail. But even failure will get you to the ultimate goal faster than getting a
job.  
  
It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're advising people to educate themselves by failing at our
expense, but it's the truth.

### **3. Not determined enough**

You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.  
  
Some people may not be determined enough to make it. It's hard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I
can't imagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't. But I know they exist.  
  
Most hackers probably underestimate their determination. I've seen a lot become visibly more determined as they get used
to running a startup. I can think of several we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be bought for $2
million, but are now set on world domination.  
  
How can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey themselves were unsure at first about starting a
company? I'm guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently driven to work on your own projects.
Though they may have been unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as if Larry and Sergey were
meek little research assistants, obediently doing their advisors' bidding. They started projects of their own.

### **4. Not smart enough**

You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder. But if you're worried about this, you're probably
mistaken. If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are.  
  
And in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much intelligence. Some startups do. You have to be good
at math to write Mathematica. But most companies do more mundane stuff where the decisive factor is effort, not brains.
Silicon Valley can warp your perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here. People who aren't smart at
least try to act that way. But if you think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a couple days in
some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.  
  
If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult, just write enterprise
software. Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're sales companies, and sales depends mostly
on effort.

### **5. Know nothing about business**

This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero. You don't need to know anything about business to start a
startup. The initial focus should be the product. All you need to know in this phase is how to build things people want.
If you succeed, you'll have to think about how to make money from it. But this is so easy you can pick it up on the
fly.  
  
I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make something great and not worry too much about making money.
And yet all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of startups that make something popular manage to
make money from it. And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy startups for, but their strategic
value. Which means, because they made something people want. Acquirers know the rule holds for them too: if users love
you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't
save you.  
  
So why do so many people argue with me? I think one reason is that they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds
could get rich from building something cool that doesn't make any money. They just don't want that to be possible. But
how possible it is doesn't depend on how much they want it to be.  
  
For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable
young hackers down the road to ruin. But now I realize this kind of controversy is a sign of a good idea.  
  
The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe. They're like undervalued stocks. If you start with
them, you'll have the whole field to yourself. So when you find an idea you know is good but most people disagree with,
you should not merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that direction. In this case, that means you
should seek out ideas that would be popular but seem hard to make money from.  
  
We'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we can't figure out how to make money from.

### **6. No cofounder**

Not having a cofounder is a real problem. A startup is too much for one person to bear. And though we differ from other
investors on a lot of questions, we all agree on this. All investors, without exception, are more likely to fund you
with a cofounder than without.  
  
We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested their first priority should be to find a cofounder.
Both did. But we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied. It's not super hard to get a cofounder
for a project that's just been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to sign up for something super
hard.  
  
If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do? Get one. It's more important than anything else. If there's no one
where you live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are people who do. If no one wants to work with
you on your current idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.  
  
If you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders. A few years out it gets harder to find them. Not
only do you have a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps even families to support. So if
you had friends in college you used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well as you can. That may
help keep the dream alive.  
  
It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a user's group or a conference. But I wouldn't be too
optimistic. You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a cofounder. \[2\]   
  
The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start startups when you're young
and there are lots of them around.

### **7. No idea**

In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because most startups change their idea anyway. In the
average Y Combinator startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the first three months. Sometimes
it's 100%.  
  
In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the initial idea that we're going to try something new this
funding cycle. We're going to let people apply with no idea at all. If you want, you can answer the question on the
application form that asks what you're going to do with "We have no idea." If you seem really good we'll accept you
anyway. We're confident we can sit down with you and cook up some promising project.  
  
Really this just codifies what we do already. We put little weight on the idea. We ask mainly out of politeness. The
kind of question on the application form that we really care about is the one where we ask what cool things you've made.
If what you've made is version one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing we care about is
whether you're good at making things. Being lead developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.  
  
That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator. What about in the general case? Because in another sense, it
is a problem if you don't have an idea. If you start a startup with no idea, what do you do next?  
  
So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas. Find something that's missing in your own life, and supply that
need‚Äîno matter how specific to you it seems. Steve Wozniak built himself a computer; who knew so many other people would
want them? A need that's narrow but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but hypothetical. So even
if the problem is simply that you don't have a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by writing
software, you're onto something, because a lot of other people have the same problem.

### **8. No room for more startups**

A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and think "this can't continue." Implicit in their
thinking is a fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there could be. But this is false. No one
claims there's any limit on the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies. Why should there be
any limit on the number who can work for equity at 5-person companies? \[3\]  
  
Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need. Breaking up companies into smaller units doesn't make those
needs go away. Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a network of startups than by a few
giant, hierarchical organizations, but I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying current needs
would lead to more. Certainly this tends to be the case in individuals. Nor is there anything wrong with that. We take
for granted things that medieval kings would have considered effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring
temperatures year round. And if things go well, our descendants will take for granted things we would consider
shockingly luxurious. There is no absolute standard for material wealth. Health care is a component of it, and that
alone is a black hole. For the foreseeable future, people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit to
the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in particular.  
  
Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly. Usually it's implicit in statements like "there are only so
many startups Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy." Maybe, though the list of acquirers is a lot longer than that. And
whatever you think of other acquirers, Google is not stupid. The reason big companies buy startups is that they've
created something valuable. And why should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire,
any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want? Maybe there would be practical limits on
the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if there is value to be had, in the form of upside that
founders are willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will evolve to consume it. Markets are
pretty smart that way.

### **9. Family to support**

This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I
don't want to take responsibility for advising it. I'm willing to take responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start
startups. So what if they fail? They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they
need it. But I'm not prepared to cross moms.  
  
What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business you can then gradually
turn into a product business. Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. You're never going to produce
Google this way. But at least you'll never be without an income.  
  
Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup instead of starting your own. Being one of the first
employees of a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and the bad. You'll be roughly 1/n^2
founder, where n is your employee number.  
  
As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start startups when you're young.

### **10. Independently wealthy**

This is my excuse for not starting a startup. Startups are stressful. Why do it if you don't need the money? For every
"serial entrepreneur," there are probably twenty sane ones who think "Start another company? Are you crazy?"  
  
I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I always pull back because I don't want four years of my
life to be consumed by random schleps. I know this business well enough to know you can't do it half-heartedly. What
makes a good startup founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.  
  
There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though. Like a lot of people, I like to work. And one of the many weird
little problems you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting people you'd like to work with are not
rich. They need to work at something that pays the bills. Which means if you want to have them as colleagues, you have
to work at something that pays the bills too, even though you don't need to. I think this is what drives a lot of serial
entrepreneurs, actually.  
  
That's why I love working on Y Combinator so much. It's an excuse to work on something interesting with people I like.

### **11. Not ready for commitment**

This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties. Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom
most of all. I was reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a few months. Nor would I have
wanted to do anything that completely took over my life the way a startup does. And that's fine. If you want to spend
your time travelling around, or playing in a band, or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a
company.  
  
If you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least three or four years. (If it fails, you'll be done a
lot quicker.) So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that scale. Be aware, though, that if you
get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have
much less spare time than you might expect. So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation
session, you may also be ready to start that startup.

### **12. Need for structure**

I'm told there are people who need structure in their lives. This seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to
tell them what to do. I believe such people exist. There's plenty of empirical evidence: armies, religious cults, and so
on. They may even be the majority.  
  
If you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a startup. In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work
for one. In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much. There may be one person whose job title is CEO, but
till the company has about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do. That's too inefficient. Each person
should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.  
  
If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team. Eleven people manage to work together in quite
complicated ways, and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else what to do. A reporter once asked
David Beckham if there were any language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about eight different
countries. He said it was never an issue, because everyone was so good they never had to talk. They all just did the
right thing.  
  
How do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a startup? If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you
aren't, then you probably are.

### **13. Fear of uncertainty**

Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because they don't like the uncertainty. If you go to work for
Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be like‚Äîall too accurately, in fact. If you
start a startup, anything might happen.  
  
Well, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem for you: if you start a startup, it will probably
fail. Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience. Hope for the best, but expect the
worst. In the worst case, it will at least be interesting. In the best case you might get rich.  
  
No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a serious effort. There may once have been a time when
employers would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now. I asked managers at big companies, and they
all said they'd prefer to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over someone who'd spent the same time
working at a big company.  
  
Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail out of laziness or incurable stupidity. I'm told
there's a lot of stigma attached to failing in other places‚Äîin Europe, for example. Not here. In America, companies,
like practically everything else, are disposable.

### **14. Don't realize what you're avoiding**

One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two make better founders than people straight from college
is that they know what they're avoiding. If their startup fails, they'll have to get a job, and they know how much jobs
suck.  
  
If you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what jobs are like, but you probably don't. Summer jobs at
technology companies are not real jobs. If you get a summer job as a waiter, that's a real job. Then you have to carry
your weight. But software companies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap labor. They do it in the
hope of recruiting them when they graduate. So while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.  
  
That will change if you get a real job after you graduate. Then you'll have to earn your keep. And since most of what
big companies do is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff. Easy, compared to college, but boring. At
first it may seem cool to get paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college. But that wears off
after a few months. Eventually it gets demoralizing to work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.  
  
And that's not the worst of it. The thing that really sucks about having a regular job is the expectation that you're
supposed to be there at certain times. Even Google is afflicted with this, apparently. And what this means, as everyone
who's had a regular job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have absolutely no desire to work on
anything, and you're going to have to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend to. To someone who
likes work, as most good hackers do, this is torture.  
  
In a startup, you skip all that. There's no concept of office hours in most startups. Work and life just get mixed
together. But the good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at work. In a startup you can do
whatever you want most of the time. If you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work. But you never
have to pretend to.  
  
If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem unprofessional. But if you're starting a startup and
you fall asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume you were tired.

### **15. Parents want you to be a doctor**

A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents. I'm not going
to say you shouldn't listen to them. Families are entitled to their own traditions, and who am I to argue with them? But
I will give you a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents really want for you.  
  
One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would be for themselves. This is actually a
rational response to their situation. Parents end up sharing more of their kids' ill fortune than good fortune. Most
parents don't mind this; it's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively conservative. And erring on the
side of conservatism is still erring. In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk. So by protecting their kids
from risk, parents are, without realizing it, also protecting them from rewards. If they saw that, they'd want you to
take more risks.  
  
The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals, they're always fighting the last war. If they want you
to be a doctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the sick, but also because it's a prestigious and
lucrative career. \[4\] But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their opinions were formed. When I was a kid
in the seventies, a doctor was *the* thing to be. There was a sort of golden triangle involving doctors,
Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis. All three vertices now seem pretty dated.  
  
The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how much things have changed. Would they be that unhappy
if you were Steve Jobs instead? So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to
treat them like feature requests. Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give
them what they ask for. Instead think about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better way to give
them what they need.

### **16. A job is the default**

This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people get regular jobs: it's the default thing to do.
Defaults are enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any conscious choice.  
  
To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you need money, you should get a job. Actually this
tradition is not much more than a hundred years old. Before that, the default way to make a living was by farming. It's
a bad plan to treat something only a hundred years old as an axiom. By historical standards, that's something that's
changing pretty rapidly.  
  
We may be seeing another such change right now. I've read a lot of economic history, and I understand the startup world
pretty well, and it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning of a change like the one from farming
to manufacturing.  
  
And you know what? If you'd been around when that change began (around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly
everyone that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing to do. Though serfs were in principle
forbidden to leave their manors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city. There were no guards patrolling the
perimeter of the village. What prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky. Leave one's plot of
land? Leave the people you'd spent your whole life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete
strangers? How would you live? How would you get food, if you didn't grow it?  
  
Frightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to live by our wits. So if it seems risky to you to start
a startup, think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do now. Oddly enough, the people who know this
best are the very ones trying to get you to stick to the old model. How can Larry and Sergey say you should come work as
their employee, when they didn't get jobs themselves?  
  
Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it. How grim it must have been to till the same fields
your whole life with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests you had to give all your surplus
to and acknowledge as your masters. I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we consider a normal job
in the same way. How grim it would be to commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and be told
what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss‚Äîsomeone who could call you into their office and say "take a
seat," and you'd sit\! Imagine having to ask *permission* to release software to users. Imagine being sad on Sunday
afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand
it?  
  
It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing. That's why I
care about startups. Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way to make a lot of money. I couldn't care less
about other ways to do that, like speculating in securities. At most those are interesting the way puzzles are. There's
more going on with startups. They may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way
[wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) is created.  
  
That's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator. We want to make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing
it, but that's not the main goal. There have only been a handful of these great economic shifts in human history. It
would be an amazing hack to make one happen faster.

### **Notes**

\[1\] The only people who lost were us. The angels had convertible debt, so they had first claim on the proceeds of the
auction. Y Combinator only got 38 cents on the dollar.  
  
\[2\] The best kind of organization for that might be an open source project, but those don't involve a lot of face to
face meetings. Maybe it would be worth starting one that did.  
  
\[3\] There need to be some number of big companies to acquire the startups, so the number of big companies couldn't
decrease to zero.  
  
\[4\] Thought experiment: If doctors did the same work, but as impoverished outcasts, which parents would still want
their kids to be doctors?

company. If you focus on trying to grow before you make a product people love, you are unlikely to succeed.

We‚Äôve said this before, but it's worth repeating‚Äìmany founders hurt their companies by focusing on growth too soon.

I'm not saying don't grow at all‚Äìgetting people to use your product, even in its earliest form, will help you better
understand what your customers want. But focusing too heavily on growth before you've built something people love leads
to the leaky bucket problem. You can get users to come in the door, but they don't stay, and likely won't return.

If you first make sure your product is loved, it will be much easier to grow. Users will be easier to retain, and
they‚Äôll tell others about what you've made. Your users essentially become a free marketing and sales force for you.
Your chances of building a giant company are much higher when you have a product that spreads by word of mouth.

Facebook, for example, had a product people talked about obsessively from the start. Airbnb slogged for 1000 days before
discovering how to make their product loved. Once they had that, it grew exponentially by word of mouth, and that still
continues today.

This is true for enterprise and hard tech companies, too‚Äì your sales process becomes much easier when word has spread
that what you're making is great.

If your product isn't loved, you might get early users, but growth will get hard later on. You'll have to rely on
inorganic means like ads, marketing, or PR to maintain your growth, and this gets very hard to sustain. And the larger
you grow, the harder it becomes to course correct. Once your company is a big moving battleship, it becomes really hard
to be nimble and quickly make the aggressive changes you need; your range of options becomes limited.

So, if you're already growing a company around a mediocre product, fix it now. Don't try to avoid the problem by raising
capital for growth‚Äì the problems will still be there, with higher expectations.

And if you're just starting out, take the time to build a product your users love, no matter how long it takes. When
they actively recommend your product to friends, you're in the right place.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html)

April 2006  
  
(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006 [Startup School](http://startupschool.org/).)  
  
The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem quicker to learn some lessons than others. I think it's
because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.  
  
We've now [invested](http://ycombinator.com/) in enough companies that I've learned a trick for determining which points
are the counterintuitive ones: they're the ones I have to keep repeating.  
  
So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding.
I'll make them all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll just be able to say: *number four\!*

### 1\. Release Early.

The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users'
reactions.  
  
By "release early" I don't mean you should release something full of bugs, but that you should release something
minimal. Users hate bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's more coming soon.  
  
There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One is that this is simply the right way to write
software, whether for a startup or not. I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict
it. I've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.
\[1\]  
  
One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users.
[Reddit](http://reddit.com/) now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have
no idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. Better to
release something and let them tell you.  
  
[Wufoo](http://wufoo.com/) took this to heart and released their form-builder before the underlying database. You can't
even drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's seat and hold the steering wheel. And Wufoo got
valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to. If
they'd waited to release everything at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired
in.  
  
Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts
as a shakedown cruise. If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one
another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it. And if you have such problems you want to find
them early.  
  
Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. When you're working on
something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's out there, problems are alarming. There is a
lot more urgency once you release. And I think that's precisely why people put it off. They know they'll have to work a
lot harder once they do. \[2\]

### 2\. Keep Pumping Out Features.

Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice. If you're going to start with
something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.  
  
What I find myself repeating is "pump out features." And this rule isn't just for the initial stages. This is something
all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.  
  
I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. By "feature" I mean one unit of
hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better.  
  
As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow. But
if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas
you implement, the more ideas you'll have. You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or
two.  
  
This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing. Users love a site that's constantly
improving. In fact, users expect a site to improve. Imagine if you visited a site that seemed very good, and then
returned two months later and not one thing had changed. Wouldn't it start to seem lame? \[3\]  
  
They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies
ignoring them. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty. You
won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.  
  
This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it? I think the problem here is that people get used to how
things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually
whatever features it happens to have become its identity. For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that
matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.  
  
I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort
of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you have is perfect. But if you had to change
something, what would it be?  
  
If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.
Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.

### 3\. Make Users Happy.

Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy. One thing all startups have in common is
that they can't force anyone to do anything. They can't force anyone to use their software, and they can't force anyone
to do deals with them. A startup has to sing for its supper. That's why the successful ones make great things. They have
to, or die.  
  
When you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds. The most powerful wind
is users. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the
pavement, as they do with most startups. Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other. If they take you up,
no competitor can keep you down.  
  
As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the
wind will catch.  
  
I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is. The vast majority of people who
visit your site will be casual visitors. It's them you have to design your site for. The people who really care will
find what they want by themselves.  
  
The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button. Think about your own experience: most links
you follow lead to something lame. Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been *trained* to click
on Back after following a link. So your site has to say "Wait\! Don't click on Back. This site isn't lame. Look at this,
for example."  
  
There are two things you have to do to make people pause. The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible,
what the hell your site is about. How often have you visited a site that seemed to assume you already knew what they
did? For example, the corporate site that says the company makes

> enterprise content management solutions for business that enable organizations to unify people, content and processes
> to minimize business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total cost of ownership.

An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can. A startup should be able to
explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does. \[4\] And not just to users. You need this for everyone:
investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. You probably shouldn't even
start a company to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two sentences.  
  
The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got, right away. If you have something impressive, try to
put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the
more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further. \[5\]  
  
In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by *showing* them. One of
the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is "show, don't tell." Don't say that a character's angry; have him
grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half. Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.  
  
The industry term here is "conversion." The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your
definition of a user is. You can measure this in your growth rate. Either your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you
must know which. If you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure you are now. And if you don't,
you need to fix something.

### 4\. Fear the Right Things.

Another thing I find myself saying a lot is "don't worry." Actually, it's more often "don't worry about this; worry
about that instead." Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.  
  
Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. Disasters are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you
discover a patent that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run into an insoluble technical
problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course. They won't kill you
unless you let them.  
  
Nor will most competitors. A lot of startups worry "what if Google builds something like us?" Actually big companies are
not the ones you have to worry about-- not even Google. The people at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they're
not as motivated, because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they
have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.  
  
What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don't know exist yet. They're
way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.  
  
Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security. You should compete against what someone
else *could* be doing, not just what you can see people doing. A corollary is that you shouldn't relax just because you
have no visible competitors yet. No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.  
  
That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. But I disagree with Caterina Fake
when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people are starting startups, but not as many more as
could. Most college graduates still think they have to get a job. The average person can't ignore something that's been
beaten into their head since they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.  
  
And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat. Way more startups hose themselves than get crushed by
competitors. There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring
users. Each is, by itself, enough to kill you. But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users. If you want a
recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone
is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.  
  
Almost everyone's initial plan is broken. If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling
programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards. In both cases their customers told them what
their business should be-- and they were smart enough to listen.  
  
As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man. You'll find more interesting
things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. This principle is very powerful. It's why
the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example. And it applies to startups too. No idea for a
product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users.

### 5\. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.

I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder,
and it's not what you might think. The most important quality in a startup founder is determination. Not intelligence--
determination.  
  
This is a little depressing. I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart, not merely determined. A lot of
people in the startup world want to believe that. Not just founders, but investors too. They like the idea of inhabiting
a world ruled by intelligence. And you can tell they really believe this, because it affects their investment
decisions.  
  
Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups
simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors. Microsoft,
Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. What students lack in experience they
more than make up in dedication.  
  
Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be determined. You have to be smart too, right? I'd like
to think so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent several years living in New York.  
  
You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill you. But lose even a little bit in the commitment
department, and that will kill you very rapidly.  
  
Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but it requires extraordinary effort. If an ordinary
employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant. Imagine if you were hired at some
big company, and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had to before, they expected you to
answer support calls, administer the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the company office space,
and go out and get everyone lunch.  
  
And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.
That's the part that really demands determination. In a startup, there's always some disaster happening. So if you're
the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.  
  
But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit. Everyone who deals
with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention.
If you lack commitment, you'll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not
to you. If you lack commitment, it will seem to you that you're unlucky.  
  
Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal
with you later. You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come to terms with you.  
  
At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a
shot for three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with it-- "something great" meaning either that
someone wants to buy them or invest millions of dollars in them. But if this is your attitude, "something great" is very
unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.  
  
If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they
don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you
earlier. Ditto for investors. What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the
fear of missing out. \[6\] So if you make it clear you're going to succeed no matter what, and the only reason you need
them is to make it happen a little faster, you're much more likely to get money.  
  
You can't fake this. The only way to convince everyone that you're ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready
to.  
  
You have to be the right kind of determined, though. I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because
stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back. A
successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people. He improvises: if someone appears
in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in the
wrong direction briefly if that will help. The one thing he'll never do is stand still. \[7\]

### 6\. There Is Always Room.

I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software.
He said he didn't think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out. Really? So in a hundred years the only social
networking sites will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and [Del.icio.us](http://Del.icio.us)? Not likely.  
  
There is always room for new stuff. At every point in history, even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were
discovering things that made everyone say "why didn't anyone think of that before?" We know this continued to be true up
till 2004, when the Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did think of that.  
  
The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, and assume that's how
things have to be. For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google.
Surely that field, at least, is tapped out. Really? In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are people still going to
search for information using something like the current Google? Even Google probably doesn't think that.  
  
In particular, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups. Sometimes you hear people saying "All these
guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy,
after all?" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken. No one proposes that there's some limit to
the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand
people each. Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten
each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard.  
  
The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even
that should be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the amount of wealth that can be created. And
I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.  
  
So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. Startups make wealth, which means they make
things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it. I still don't
even have a flying car.

### 7\. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.

This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator. It was practically the corporate motto at
Viaweb.  
  
Startup founders are naturally optimistic. They wouldn't do it otherwise. But you should treat your optimism the way
you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous. You have to build a shield
around it, or it will fry you.  
  
The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be useless if it were. It's pierced in a few places to let
pipes in. An optimism shield has to be pierced too. I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of
yourself, and what you expect of other people. It's ok to be optimistic about what you can do, but assume the worst
about machines and other people.  
  
This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing. So
things don't happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the world. Things change suddenly, and usually
for the worse.  
  
Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not
going to happen. The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't. The company that says they're going to buy you
isn't. The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't. Then if things work out you can be
pleasantly surprised.  
  
The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being *disappointed* when things fall
through. It's for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their company against something that's going to
fall over, taking them with it.  
  
For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.
That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they *want* you to stop looking. And you want to stop too, because
doing deals is a pain. Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink. So you have to consciously force yourself to
keep looking.  
  
Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better
terms. Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest, there's not a single point where you
shake hands and the deal's done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake,
and if the other side senses weakness-- if they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw you in the
details.  
  
VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators. They're trained to take advantage of weakness. \[8\] So while
they're often nice guys, they just can't help it. And as pros they do this more than you. So don't even try to bluff
them. The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it. And if you don't believe in a
deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.  
  
So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you hear someone say the words "we want to invest in you"
or "we want to acquire you," I want the following phrase to appear automatically in your head: *don't get your hopes
up.* Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist. Nothing is more likely to make it close.  
  
The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it
while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.

### **Speed, not Money**

The way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful. It is. When I talk to the founders of the
companies we've funded, they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't realize it would be this
hard.  
  
So why do it? It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or heroic, but just to make
money? Is making money really that important?  
  
No, not really. It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously. I regard making money as a boring
errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible. There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se.  
  
So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups? I'll tell you why. Economically, a startup is best seen not as a
way to get rich, but as a way to work faster. You have to make a living, and a startup is a way to get that done
quickly, instead of letting it drag on through your whole life. \[9\]   
  
We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly miraculous. It is also palpably short. You're given
this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away. You can see why people invent gods to explain it. But even to
people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect. There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a
blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious. As Ben Franklin said, if you
love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.  
  
So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money. That's not what makes startups worth the trouble. What's
important about startups is the speed. By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest
possible time, you show respect for life, and there is something grand about that.

### **Notes**

\[1\] Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not fixing them fast enough, but I don't know of any
that died from releasing something stable but minimal very early, then promptly improving it.  
  
\[2\] I know this is why I haven't released Arc. The moment I do, I'll have people nagging me for features.  
  
\[3\] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect. Users judge a site not as a
single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames. Of the two, I'd say the rate of improvement is more important
to users than where you currently are.  
  
\[4\] It should not always tell this to users, however. For example, MySpace is basically a replacement mall for
mallrats. But it was wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.  
  
\[5\] Similarly, don't make users register to try your site. Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should
gladly register to get at it. But they've been trained to expect the opposite. Most of the things they've tried on the
web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.  
  
\[6\] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don't make their money (if they make money) off their median
investments. In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate mediocre returns, and one or two
"make the fund" by succeeding spectacularly. So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could
hose the whole fund.  
  
\[7\] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer. Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past
multiple defenders, a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes.  
  
\[8\] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to
turn into them.  
  
\[9\] There are two ways to do [work you love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html): (a) to make money, then work on
what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love. In practice the first phases of both
consist mostly of unedifying schleps, and in (b) the second phase is less secure.

and how hearing a family‚Äôs toilet flush can make it all worthwhile.

**<span class='t-orange'>YC :</span> [The Detroit Water Project](https://www.detroitwaterproject.org) has helped more
than 950 families keep access to running water since it was founded just 16 months ago. Can you take us back to the
beginning? How did this start?**

<b class='t-orange'>Tiffani Ashley Bell :</b> Last summer in 2014, I was a Code for America fellow, working on software
with the City of Atlanta. With government stuff, when you‚Äôre working on projects at that level, there is often a lot of
downtime as you wait for things to go through.

Before I get up in the morning, I usually scroll through Twitter on my phone. One morning in July of last year I read an
article in the Atlantic about how there were 100,000 people in Detroit who were about to have their water shut off for
owing money to the water company. The article said that something like 50 percent of the Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department‚Äôs customers were behind on their bills. If you were $150 behind for at least 2 months, you were eligible for
shut off.

This story really bothered me. It just *really* bothered me. This was a city-run water company having this issue. I
thought it was shady that this was the city‚Äôs solution. How is turning off a household‚Äôs access to clean water helping
people who are already hurting, who are already behind on their bills?

I ended up not even going into the office that day. I just stayed in the house, in my pajamas, reading more and more
about what was going on, taking phone calls, trying to figure out how this was happening and how to help. I talked a lot
about the situation on Twitter, posting my thoughts and findings, and reading other people‚Äôs reactions and ideas. Kristy
Tillman, who became my co-founder, said, ‚ÄúI would pay someone else‚Äôs bill if I could pay it directly to the water
company.‚Äù

Meanwhile, I had been clicking all around on the water company‚Äôs website, and I found a 400-page PDF document that was a
list of account numbers of people who owed money that the water company supposedly couldn‚Äôt deliver bills to by mail. We
took one of the account numbers and plugged it into the utility company‚Äôs website, and it showed a lot of information:
How much was owed, consumption history, payment history. And there was a payment button.

So we put together a quick site on Heroku that night. In the beginning it was really just an ugly site with a link to a
Google Form that basically said, ‚ÄòIf you need help, sign up here.‚Äô We wanted to connect with the people behind that big
list of accounts, with the hopes of eventually being a platform for telling their stories. Then we just started Tweeting
that out.

**So this whole thing was taking shape in real-time in public, all on Twitter?**

Yes. My cofounder Kristy and I hadn't even met in person yet at that point\! But we had been Twitter contacts for a long
time.

I‚Äôm just now getting to the point that I‚Äôve met most of the people I've talked to on Twitter in person -- whether at a
conference, or travel, or just through work in San Francisco. But there are all these people I‚Äôve talked to and shared
thoughts with for years.

**What was the response like?**

It was a Thursday that we launched the site, and the response from the press and from donors was just immediate and
incredible. We actually ended up then spending the whole weekend trying to find a person in Detroit to help\! At the
beginning, we had a bunch more people signed up to pledge than we had signed up to receive the money.

**How did you end up connecting to the people who needed help?**

Originally we just did social media promotion, but we quickly saw that was not useful for the folks who needed the help.
So we printed out postcards and mailed them to different places in Detroit. The Postal Service has a widget on its
website that lets you pick a mail route and see how many houses are on it and how much it would cost to send a postcard
to that route. We just picked the most prevalent zip code that we found in that big PDF of accounts.

It took off from there by word of mouth. We helped a few people, and they‚Äôd tell a bunch of people. I think if you have
something that really works and is honest, word of mouth is the best marketing you can get.

**How did this go from being a project, to being a full-time endeavor for you?**

Soon after we launched, my work at the fellowship in Atlanta also picked up, and before I knew it I was juggling 2 full
time jobs\!

I just thought, ‚ÄúI have to figure out a way to keep this going, because people keep applying for help with their bills.‚Äù
For me it was clearly just an obvious thing that needs to exist, so I knew I needed to do my best to keep it going.

So we applied to YC to take part as a non-profit. It worked out: The Code for America fellowship ended the same weekend
we got accepted to Y Combinator.

**How has your understanding of the water crisis in Detroit changed since you first read about the issue?**

Being a Code for America fellow, I was able to basically get access to whoever I wanted in the government in Atlanta.
You quickly see that even if the government is not perfect, the people in City Hall are not terrible people. They come
to work for the most part because they want to help people. So based on what I knew from Atlanta, I knew that it
couldn‚Äôt be that there were just terrible people running the water company in Detroit.

It turns out this whole water crisis thing goes back a while. In the City of Detroit, generally, the water company is
the one thing that still brings in money every month -- there are a lot of people who still pay consistently. But the
city has taken out billions in bonds, so they owe Wall Street a lot of money. They see the water company as the only
place to try and get that money back.

Once you‚Äôre behind on your bill for two months and the water has been turned off, there‚Äôs a $30 reconnection fee to turn
it back on. If you were already behind on your bill though, there‚Äôs a chance you can‚Äôt afford that. So there are people
who will come around with a crowbar and a pickup truck to turn it back on illegally. But if the water company finds out
you did that, they charge a $250 fine. You can see how these things just add up.

**Has there been any criticism?**

I remember at first we‚Äôd have some people calling this a ‚ÄúBand-Aid solution.‚Äù Now, I understand where that comes from.
And in a way, I agree with them\! Our intention has never been to just pay people‚Äôs bills indefinitely. That‚Äôs not
sustainable, and it doesn‚Äôt encourage utility companies to look at their pricing and policies.

But I never saw this as a Band-Aid solution. It was just the most simple and elegant thing to do at that time.

Water is an essential thing that we all need. I don‚Äôt have this fantasy that everything should just be free. I
understand that utilities cost money to run. But I think the policies could be better. I think there is a better way to
work with people. If someone can‚Äôt afford a $150 bill, shutting off their water isn‚Äôt going to change that, and it is
very likely to make the problem worse. If you are a week before Thanksgiving and your family does not have running
water, if you are looking for a job and going on an interview but you can‚Äôt take a shower, you don‚Äôt need to hear that
changing that would be a Band-Aid.

Our approach was to do what needs to be done to get people‚Äôs water turned back on, while also looking further into what
causes people to need this help in the first place. We‚Äôre stopping the bleeding while also helping treat the underlying
wound.

**How has the organization itself evolved over the past year?**

A lot of how this has evolved has been in the lean startup model. Our core issue is about water affordability and
access. Right now, that‚Äôs manifested with this large group of people who can‚Äôt pay their water bills. So we started with
the smallest possible thing we could do to begin to chip away at the problem: Paying those bills to get the water turned
back on.

I went to college in D.C., and though I majored in computer science, I‚Äôm also a closet policy wonk. When I saw this
problem, I knew we couldn‚Äôt change the laws overnight. There were already people protesting the situation, so we weren‚Äôt
going to go that route. We did the quickest thing we could do to alleviate the problem.

Now we‚Äôre maturing as an organization, and the second phase of building our platform will be working toward addressing
root causes. In our data and collecting these stories, we‚Äôve seen that there are a few common threads behind people who
are getting their water shut off: People who have lost a job, people with a medical issue that‚Äôs sent a financial shock
through the family, people who have paid money to someone like a landlord who is not using it to pay the water bill,
senior citizens who have not applied for all of the programs they are eligible for.

We‚Äôre also adding internal improvements like tracking funds, adding administrative layers, improving customer service,
shortening response times to people. But we couldn‚Äôt have gotten here at all if we hadn‚Äôt started the way that we did.

**It sounds like these kinds of issues can‚Äôt be unique to Detroit.**

Exactly. This is just one city. We‚Äôve also launched the program in Baltimore, and we‚Äôre starting to work with other
cities too -- we‚Äôre hoping to launch Philadelphia in the spring, for instance.

With each new city, we‚Äôre learning about different policies, different criteria for shutoff and fines. There is a lot of
policy design that we‚Äôre implementing through software.

**How have the cities and the water companies responded? I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd have to be quite positive?**

In the beginning, not so much actually. Like I said, at the start, we had a lopsided situation where we had a lot more
donors than people we could connect to help. We were frantically trying to reach out to the city to tell them, ‚ÄúWe have
a ton of money here, if you can just help us connect with the people to give it to, you‚Äôll be doing a great thing.‚Äù

I made some calls, and eventually got through to the Mayor‚Äôs Chief of Staff. She essentially just blew me off. She was
pretty condescending, honestly. So we just went through YC, and kept doing it on our own.

We‚Äôd been able to scrape all this data from the water company‚Äôs website, but there is a ton of other data that we often
needed too. If I had a question about a certain account and whether it had been shut off yet or not, I‚Äôd have to sit on
the customer support line for 30 or 40 minutes, like everyone else. There was one time when I went in person to the
utility company in Detroit to pay bills. When I finally got to the front of the line I said, ‚ÄúI run this non-profit, and
I have about 50 accounts that I‚Äôd like to get information for.‚Äù The woman at the desk just said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a new request,
so you‚Äôll have to go to the back of the line for that.‚Äù

I got to a point this past summer after a year where I started to get really fed up with the things we had to do to help
people. I was like, ‚ÄúHell, we're sending all this money to you probably would have never gotten anyway. There's got to
be something you can do to help facilitate.‚Äù

Finally, through Jen Pahlka at Code for America, I was put in touch with the CIO for the City of Detroit. I told her the
situation, and she put me directly in touch with the COO of the water company. I was able to explain to them who we are
and what we‚Äôre doing. We've been working directly with them for 3 weeks ago, and it‚Äôs been a totally different
experience. So we‚Äôre getting there, but it‚Äôs taken a while.

The ideal situation would be for us to have our own portal with the information we need, in every city that we‚Äôre in.
We‚Äôre working toward that now.

**Encountering bureaucracy like that for so long, a lot of people would probably have gotten frustrated and just given
up. Do you think you‚Äôre especially tenacious?**

Well, that‚Äôs not quite true. I will quit on some things in a second\! \[laughs\] But not stuff that I care about. I
turned 30 this past summer, and I‚Äôve realized that even more as I get older. For things I care about, I really can't let
them go.

I was in Detroit over the past year, and I visited this lady's house, one of the people we had helped with the bills.
She had five kids she was raising on her own -- two of them were her own, and three she had adopted from her best friend
who had died, which had put a strain on her finances. Her water had been shut off, and she had periods also of having no
electricity. I was standing there talking to her about how much the project had helped her, and I heard one of the kids
flushing the toilet in the background. That sound is something you and I might take for granted, but for that family, it
was an important thing. All this work we‚Äôre doing has a tangible, real impact.

So no, I don‚Äôt think of myself as having a special amount of tenacity. The folks this product is for that aren't the
usual affluent 20-somethings living in San Francisco. We cater to someone who is totally different. These are regular,
hard-working folks who are going through tough situations: Grandmas, aunts, uncles.

I think about all the other jobs or things I could have been doing as an engineer, and I can‚Äôt imagine anything else
that I‚Äôd want to do more.

a company where people want to work *at the same time*. It‚Äôs usually not enough to *just* have a great product, or
*just* be a great place to work, because great people build great products, and great people won‚Äôt tolerate a bad
environment for very long.

People leave managers, not companies, yet while most founders are obsessive about trying to build a product that people
love, many first-time founders raise a bunch of money and start building a team without any management experience at
all.

I was one of those first-time founders who had to quickly learn on the job, so here‚Äôs some advice I wish someone had
given me when I was just beginning to grow and manage a team at [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/).

**Delegate\!** As a founder you‚Äôre used to doing it all, and it can be scary to shed responsibilities you‚Äôve always
owned, but you can‚Äôt scale yourself and focus on the highest leverage opportunities until you get things off your plate.
If you think you‚Äôre going to have to work especially late or can‚Äôt get to the things you need to in a given day, take
that as a signal to delegate to your team.

**Create growth opportunities.** Great people often care about personal growth way more than money or any other tangible
benefit you could offer them, so the flip-side of delegating your responsibilities is that you create opportunities for
people on your team to do new things, learn, and grow. Don‚Äôt hoard them all for yourself.

**Invest in your stars.** Similar to how it‚Äôs much easier to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one, it‚Äôs
much easier to keep an existing star employee happy than find a new star. Go above and beyond to make sure your stars
feel valued, appreciated, and rewarded.

Set a high bar. Great people want to do big, meaningful things. Push your team with aggressive goals, and you might be
surprised what they will accomplish.

**Lead by example.** Teams embody the characteristics of their leaders, and the things you care about will be the things
your team cares about. If you sweat the details, your team will learn to sweat the details too.

**Your team‚Äôs success is your success.** Get satisfaction and the feeling of accomplishment from the success of your
team. As an individual contributor, it‚Äôs easy to look back at the end of a week and feel good about all that you‚Äôve
directly produced. As a manager, you‚Äôre responsible for the accomplishments of your team, which can be a difficult
transition for a lot of people. The advantage is that you can scale yourself and your vision.

**Deflect all credit and absorb all blame.** Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù when talking about a screw-up, and use ‚Äúwe‚Äù (or better yet,
specific contributors‚Äô names) when talking about successes. A little recognition goes a long way to make people feel
valued.

**Share the big picture.** It‚Äôs important for people on your team to understand how their work and role fits into the
big picture of the business, and why they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôll give them a sense of purpose and motivation
to understand how they‚Äôre contributing to the success of the business. It‚Äôs easy to take it for granted that your team
is clear on this, but this is one of those things where you want to constantly make that connection.

**Repeat yourself often.** You should feel like you sound like a broken record about the things that are important to
your company‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour mission, your vision, your KPIs, etc. You think about it all the time, but the people on your team
don‚Äôt, and most people need to hear something many times before it truly gets ingrained in their memory. You‚Äôll know
you‚Äôre repeating key messages enough when every single person on your team will be able to explain them to a complete
stranger exactly how you would‚Äôve said it.

**You‚Äôre in charge.** It can be uncomfortable telling people what to do if you‚Äôve never done it before. But you are the
leader, and everyone on your team will be looking to you for direction and guidance, so own it. People want structure
and direction, so don‚Äôt be afraid to use phrases like ‚ÄúI need‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want‚Ä¶‚Äù to shape your team in your image.

**Focus on the What, not the How.** Communicate your vision for what success looks like, to give your team a framework
and goals to guide their decisions and work. It‚Äôs a way for you to ‚Äúbe in the room‚Äù when the work gets done without
micromanaging the work.

**Set deadlines and hold people accountable.** When you give someone a task, ask ‚Äúby when?‚Äù, then add a note to your
calendar to follow up to make sure it‚Äôs complete. If standards or deadlines are not being met, give direct feedback to
change future behavior.

**Verbalize your thoughts.** Simply saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed in this work‚Äù is extremely powerful in helping
people directly understand where you stand. People aren‚Äôt mind-readers, so rather than just jumping into solutions when
giving feedback, state your feelings out loud to be clear and direct.

**Manage for the employee.** My favorite interview question for manager candidates is ‚ÄúHow would you describe your
management style?‚Äù, where the best possible answer is ‚Äúit depends on the employee‚Äù. Each person has a unique combination
of experience, motivations, personality, etc, and it‚Äôs up to you to take the right management approach that helps them
succeed and maximizes their contribution.

**Understand that everyone‚Äôs different.** Just because you may be an achiever that‚Äôs self-motivated to get things done
doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone else on your team is. Get curious to figure out what drives and motivates each individual on
your team, rather than assuming everyone‚Äôs like you.

**Hire slow, fire fast.** It‚Äôs the thing everyone says and few have the discipline to do, but hiring well is the most
important thing you can possibly do to positively impact your business and your team. Great people want to work with
other great people, so resist the temptation to fill open positions with mediocre candidates, and don‚Äôt settle. You
should be thrilled about each new hire.

Hire for hunger. It‚Äôs great when a potential candidate walks in the door with all the skills needed to succeed in the
role, but passion for your mission, business, and team will do more to drive an employee to make a big, long-term impact
than any specific skills they may have. Passionate employees will be quicker to teach themselves new skills too,
especially as your business changes and grows.

**Set your team up for success.** It‚Äôs unfair to expect even the best people to hit the ground running on day one
without being properly onboarded. As their manager, it‚Äôs your responsibility to invest the time early on to set
expectations, show them the ropes, teach them about your business, train them, and provide clear direction and a
well-defined role. Anything less will diminish their ability to succeed.

**Your trust should be earned.** Don‚Äôt just assume that new and more inexperienced team members will hit the ground
running and understand your expectations from day one. Make them prove themselves first by working more closely with
them and frequently reviewing their work until they‚Äôve earned your full trust.

**Shield your team from distractions.** Provide structure, focus, and clear goals for your team to maximize their
ability to execute on the strategy. They should come in to work each day knowing exactly what they‚Äôre working on and
exactly what they need to do, and any other distractions should be deflected to keep from derailing productivity,
wasting time, and knocking the team off course.

**Include your team in decision-making.** If you‚Äôve hired great people, you‚Äôd be crazy not to include them in important
decisions. Define the decision-making process upfront to set expectations for your team‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill it be a decision by
committee, will someone else on your team own the decision, or will you gather feedback to make the final call yourself?
Listen to their thoughts and opinions with an open mind, make sure everyone feels heard, then decide the best course of
action. It may even go against the consensus of the team, and that‚Äôs ok so long as you‚Äôve defined the process and
expectations up front. Even if your team disagrees with the final call, by including them in the process they will
better understand the decision, feel like their opinion was valued, and be able to get on board to help support the
decision going forward.

**A little professional tension is healthy.** Differing perspectives help make teams and products better, so a little
professional tension can be really valuable to help push your team to think about things in new ways. It should be
net-positive though, so if it‚Äôs forcing too many decisions to get stuck in the mud, or if the tension moves from
professional to personal, then you need to take action to eliminate it quickly before it drags down the team or blows
up.

**Show your work.** Explain your decision-making process. Whenever you take a controversial action or make a difficult
decision, it‚Äôs especially powerful to fully explain how you arrived at that decision so your team can understand your
thought process and rationale, and ultimate help support the decision.

**It‚Äôs ok to not always know the answer.** Ask questions, probe, and admit when you don‚Äôt know the answer to something.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with saying you‚Äôll need some time to think or learn more before making an important decision.

**Have consistent 1-on-1s every week.** These are for the benefit of your employees, so you should let them drive the
agenda each week. From your side, it‚Äôs an opportunity to set aside some focused time each week to talk privately, get on
the same page, and ask open-ended questions like ‚Äúhow are things going?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow are you feeling?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat are your
thoughts on the big news that was announced earlier this week?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your opinion on X?‚Äù, etc. Prioritize these
meetings in your schedule, go out of your way to keep from canceling or rescheduling them whenever possible, and your
consistent time and attention will send a signal to your team that you care about their happiness.

**Ease the maker to manager transition.** As you scale from a team of individual contributors to a more structured org,
the maker to manager transition will challenge your best people. Just because someone is an outstanding individual
contributor doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be an outstanding manager right off the bat, because it requires a completely different
set of skills and experience. And during the transition, their instinct will be to take on both their prior maker and
their new manager duties ‚Äì spending 75% effort on making and 75% effort on managing ‚Äì a 150% workload resulting in less
than 100% output in each area. Put structure in place to allow them to focus on being a manager first and foremost, and
take maker duties off of their plate.

**Create a career path.** Every 6 months, ask your employees where they want to be in their career in the next 2‚Äì3
years. Work with them to put together a plan, help them get the skills and experience they need, and guide them on a
course to get there.

[32m2024-02-05 20:11:25 +0100[0m - dagster - [34mINFO[0m - __ASSET_JOB - aa86ea93-ffee-453e-b9b0-7056271dbf6c - chunked_blog_docs - While working with companies in YC‚Äôs Series A program, we‚Äôve noticed a common problem: founders don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúgood‚Äù
looks like in a term sheet. This makes sense, because it is often, literally, the first time in their careers that
they‚Äôve seen one. This puts founders at a significant disadvantage because VCs see term sheets all the time and know
what to expect. Because we‚Äôve invested in so many founders over the years and have seen hundreds of Series A term
sheets, we know what ‚Äúgood‚Äù looks like. We work with our founders to understand where terms diverge from ‚Äúgood‚Äù, what
they can do about that divergence, and when and how it makes sense to negotiate.

Below is what a Series A term sheet looks like with standard and clean terms from a good Silicon Valley VC. Bracketed
items (besides the names of the company and lead investor) are always or frequently negotiated. Items not in brackets
are sometimes negotiated, but this has more to do with the idiosyncratic features of the company or the situation, and
generally aren‚Äôt terms that parties intend to heavily bargain over during the negotiation.

One of the critical things you‚Äôll notice is that we didn‚Äôt put in standard pricing. While the lead in a Series A round
generally wants 20% of the company, pricing can flex up and down depending on the leverage held by each side. We think
price is an important term, but too specific to each raise to try to create a standard. We‚Äôre more concerned with terms
around control and structure that are less familiar to founders, and therefore more prone to cause confusion and
trouble.

Note: this term sheet doesn‚Äôt belong to any particular VC -- we drafted it -- but it does substantively reflect what we
see most often. Founders with a lot of negotiating leverage can sometimes do better, and the converse is true too.

[You can also download the Word version of the doc from this page.](https://www.ycombinator.com/series_a_term_sheet/)

It may be surprising to see everything covered in a single page.[1](#footnote1) This wasn‚Äôt always the case, but became
common over the last decade as some investors decided to make their term sheets more user friendly by shortening the
legalese as if to say, ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt going to get bogged down in the minutiae. We‚Äôre going to make this easy, friendly,
standard and fast.‚Äù

This leads us to the most important thing to understand about the term sheet: it‚Äôs another way in which your Series A
investor might be telling you something. A contract allocates risks between the parties, so the terms the investor
insists on can sometimes say a lot about the investor‚Äôs perceived risks. These perceived risks show up in a couple of
ways.

The first way relates to control terms. We don‚Äôt mean the set of investor vetoes in the ‚ÄúVoting Rights‚Äù section, which
are pretty standard fare,[2](#footnote2) but rather issues of board composition and the investor‚Äôs ability to block or
dictate operational decisions made by the board. The board structure in this term sheet is founder-friendly because the
founders retain board control 2-1.[3](#footnote3) The way in which founders most often lose control at the Series A is
with a 2-2-1 board structure, i.e. 2 founders, 2 investors and an independent board member. The loss of board control is
most significant because it means the founders can be fired from their own company.[4](#footnote4) Another way in which
founders lose some control is a term that doesn‚Äôt appear in the standard example above, which is a separate provision
that says the investor director‚Äôs approval is required for operational decisions like setting the annual budget,
hiring/firing executives, pivoting the business, adding new lines of business, etc. When boards are set up to take power
away from founders, the investor‚Äôs outward justification will frequently be reasons of governance or accountability. But
the more power that‚Äôs taken away, the more it‚Äôs undeniable that the investor is attempting to structure away a perceived
risk. So when an investor says that they‚Äôre committed to partnering with you for the long-term - or that they‚Äôre betting
everything on you - but then tells you something else with the terms that they insist on, believe the terms.

The other way perceived risks manifest is if a term sheet includes non-standard or ‚Äúdirty‚Äù economic terms. Here, the
term sheet example is instructive not for what it contains but what it *doesn‚Äôt*. Examples of such terms would be:

  - Liquidation preference greater than 1x -- the investor gets back more than its invested capital first.
  - Participating preferred -- the investor double-dips by getting its money back plus its pro rata portion of exit
    proceeds, rather than choosing between the two.
  - Cumulative dividends -- the investor compounds its liquidation preference every year by X%, which increases the
    economic hurdle that has to be cleared before founders and employees see any value.
  - Warrant coverage -- the investor gets extra fully diluted ownership without paying for it at the agreed upon
    valuation.

These are all ways of adding structure to reduce typical venture risk, either directly by boosting the investor‚Äôs
downside economics, or indirectly by juicing the upside outcomes. The investor is essentially saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sort of
afraid of losing my money.‚Äù It can also foreshadow how they might behave when things aren‚Äôt going well, such as pushing
you to sell when you don‚Äôt want to, or dial back risk when it‚Äôs important to take it. Good investors would rather
address economic risks by negotiating valuation, and are otherwise happy to give standard terms because they know that
the real money in venture is not made with structure, but by building long-term value, which they are confident in their
ability to help you do.

The last thing to remember is that your Series A documents are a foundation and precedent for the terms of future
rounds. Good foundations make the next term sheet and financing round fast and simple, as future investors just step
into the same straightforward terms. Doing the opposite complicates future fundraises, such as future investors asking
for the same structure-heavy terms, existing investors refusing to drop terms that subsequent investors want removed as
a precondition of investing, etc. Unwinding bad terms is difficult, and oftentimes impossible.

That said, the point is to get a clean deal, not to cycle a lot to get the perfect deal. No one ever built an enduring
company just by winning their Series A negotiation. Also, even if you can‚Äôt get everything right or the way you want it,
you always have the power to execute. If you do that, the value you build can outrun suboptimal terms or establish
leverage to renegotiate later. So don‚Äôt lose sight of the ultimate goal: closing fast and getting back to work.

**Notes**

**1.** Some great investors still send longer term sheets, but this has more to do with their preference for going a bit
deeper into the details at this stage, rather than deferring this until the definitive documents. The definitive
documents are derived from the term sheet and are the much longer (100+ pages) binding contracts that everyone signs and
closes on. It‚Äôs common to negotiate a few additional points at this stage, though deviation from anything explicitly
addressed in the term sheet is definitely re-trading. Also, in a few places, this term sheet refers to certain terms as
being ‚Äústandard.‚Äù That may seem vague and circular, but term sheets frequently do describe certain terms that way. What
that really means is that there‚Äôs an accepted practice of what appears in the docs for these terms among the lawyers who
specialize in startups and venture deals, so make sure your lawyer (and the investor‚Äôs lawyer) fit that
description.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid1)

**2.** The two most impactful investor vetoes in this section are the veto on a financing, which is covered by clauses
(ii) and (iii), and the veto on a sale of the company, which is in clause (vii). We point these out because the concrete
implications of these clauses aren‚Äôt facially obvious, and because most term sheets use similar technical jargon for
these vetoes.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid2)

**3.** The founders implicitly control those 2 seats because they‚Äôre designated by a majority of common, and founders
generally control a majority of common for a long time. In even more founder-friendly term sheets, those 2 seats may be
designated by the founders themselves (as individuals).[‚Ü©](#footnoteid3)

**4.** Whether being fired from the company as an employee also triggers the removal of the founder from the board is a
separate question and depends on what was negotiated in the financing documents. Sometimes a founder‚Äôs right to vote her
shares to appoint a director will be conditioned on the founder being currently employed by the company. Whenever
conditions are attached to your rights to vote on anything, make sure to ask your lawyer to walk you through the various
scenarios in which those conditions matter and how they can hurt you.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid4)

-----

Once you've found an engineer you want to hire, the final step is presenting them an offer to join your team and
convincing them to accept it. This post offers advice for increasing the percentage of the offers you make that are
accepted. Since working on Triplebyte I've been surprised by just how much variance there is in this rate among
companies. Companies that use Triplebyte have acceptance rates ranging from as low as 10% to as high as 90%.

Generating an offer for an engineer is expensive. It takes time to source good candidates and then hours of your
engineering team's time doing technical phone screens and onsite interviews. You'll likely need to complete five onsite
interviews to generate a single offer (the industry standard onsite interview to offer rate for engineers is
around 20%). Assuming six hours of engineering time spent interviewing that's 30 hours of engineering productivity lost.
Given this cost it makes economic sense to work as hard as you can to get your offers accepted.

The work to increase your offer acceptance rate begins well before presenting the offer itself. It starts with designing
a great candidate experience at each step leading up to the offer. Every interaction a candidate has with you must
balance your need to extract signal from them while still getting them excited about joining. This begins with doing
something seemingly simple - being responsive.

## Speed

Read this [blog
post](https://kellysutton.com/2016/10/20/visualizing-a-job-search-or-how-to-find-a-job-as-a-software-engineer.html) to
get an engineer's perspective on the importance of speed and responsiveness in their job search process. Being fast and
responsive seems like obvious advice and yet we still see companies move slowly and miss out on good people. There's two
reasons this happens.

The first is entropy. Maintaining an organized system for managing candidates is hard. It will naturally trend towards
disorder unless you work really hard against it. This is especially true for larger companies with more people and
processes. As a smaller startup speed is a huge advantage you have over them when competing for engineers.

Make this easier for yourself by using software to manage and track the status of your candidates. At first you can use
something simple like a spreadsheet or Airtable. As you grow and need to setup interview panels to gather feedback from
interviewers you should graduate to a real ATS (Applicant Tracking System) like [Lever](http://lever.co/). Make it clear
who has responsibility for reviewing and acting on candidates every day.

The second reason is psychological. It's easy to believe that candidates who drop out because you were slow weren't
interested in your company anyway. This is bad reasoning and will make you miss out on good candidates. Managing a job
search process quickly becomes overwhelming, especially for the best candidates with the most options. To even have the
chance to close the best candidates treat every candidate dropping out before you replied them as a failure, not a lucky
escape.

With an organized and responsive process in place you can now focus on optimizing the quality of each candidate
interaction. This starts with the first call.

# First Call

The first call with a candidate typically lasts for about 25 minutes. I'd recommend the following agenda:

1.  Introduce yourself, the company and what you work on.
2.  Ask the candidate to introduce themselves and talk about what's important to them in their next role (if you did the
    initial outreach and they're not actively looking, you can soften this to e.g. ‚Äúhow do you think about developing
    your career and skills in the future?‚Äù).
3.  Ask questions about their skills and experiences to see if they match with what you're looking for.
4.  Pitch the work being done at the company and why it's an exciting time to join now.
5.  Finish with answering any questions they have and explain what the next steps in your hiring process are.

It's common to leave asking the candidate what they're looking for until the end of the call. I think that's suboptimal
because you miss the opportunity to tailor your pitch around it throughout the call.

If you're an early stage company (less than 20 people) a founder should always be doing this call with engineering
candidates. Commonly you'll have one technical founder and one non-technical/sales founder. I'd recommend the sales
founder do these calls even if they can't speak in detail about the technical challenges. This gives the technical
founder more uninterrupted time to build ([maker vs manager schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)).
The sales founder should at least have enough sales ability to convince engineers to meet the technical founder in
person to learn more about the technology.

As you grow you'll hire a recruiter and typically they'll do these calls. I'd recommend doing the following to best set
them up for success:

1.  Ask your recruiter to send you a monthly report on number of first calls they're doing and the % that opt'ed out of
    coming onsite. Have your recruiter keep a list of reasons why candidates said they wouldn't move forward and
    continually review these with them to improve the pitch.
2.  Assign one engineer to train your recruiter on how to talk about the interesting technical challenges at the
    company. Have them listen to mock pitches, give feedback, and repeat. I often see companies give their recruiter no
    help in learning how to best pitch the company and then complain when they see low conversions. That's not fair to
    them nor optimal for you.
3.  Asking technical vetting questions is difficult for recruiters as they're usually not technical. This is usually the
    most awkward aspect of the interactions between engineers and recruiters. Give your recruiter support and structure
    so they can do this well. I'd advise giving them specific technical questions to ask. One idea I've seen companies
    use to good effect is making them multiple choice format so the recruiter can read out the answers and ask the
    candidate to pick one that fits best. This helps your recruiter feel confident and provide a better candidate
    experience.
4.  If you're working on a deeply technical product that doesn't yet have marquee customers or traction, I'd actually
    recommend having an engineer do these first calls, at least for particularly promising candidates. In this case your
    main selling point is the depth of your technical challenges and it'll be very hard to find a recruiter who can
    pitch those well.

## Technical Phone Screen

If the first call goes well you'll usually move the candidate forward to a technical phone screen with an engineer
(companies that use Triplebyte will skip these phone screens and move straight to the onsite). These phone screens are
usually 45 minutes of the candidate working through a coding problem and screen sharing. I'd recommend allotting one
full hour for the phone screen. 45 minutes for working through a technical problem and up to 15 minutes for a
conversation between the candidate and engineer to ask each other questions.

Ideally you want to select the engineers who are best at pitching your company for these phone screens. There are also
ways to make the experience more candidate friendly e.g. letting them pick from several problems to solve during the
call. This creates some more work for you but if a candidate can show their strength on a problem they enjoy they'll
have a more positive feeling towards you. You can also let them code in their own environment and screen share with you
instead of using an artificial environment (though some of these e.g. Coderpad do have advantages of better
collaboration and recording features).

If the technical phone screen goes well, the next step is the onsite interview.

## Onsite Interview

The onsite interview will be the first time a candidate meets your team in person. Their experience throughout the day
will be a huge deciding factor in where they end up. It's important to think through the details of the candidate
experience when setting up your onsite. Start with the basic logistics and be sure to:

1.  Send an email ahead of time with clear directions to the office.
2.  Assign someone to greet them when they arrive
3.  Have somewhere they can hang out if they arrive early (even if it's just a spare desk and chair)

A standard onsite interview agenda will typically look like this:

1.  Quick welcome and talking through the agenda for the day (5 minutes)
2.  Technical interview 1 (1 hour)
3.  Technical interview 2 (1 hour)
4.  Lunch (1 hour)
5.  Technical interview 3 (1 hour)
6.  Technical interview 4 (1 hour)
7.  Behavioral / culture interview (45 mins)
8.  Closing Q\&A for them to ask about the company (25 minutes)

If you're early stage I'd recommend having at least one of the founders involved in the closing Q\&A. It can also be a
good idea to include a demo or roadmap section here at the end. Give the candidate a sneak preview of a new feature
you're working on or talk through the most exciting upcoming projects so they finish the day feeling excited about your
future momentum.

We asked engineers using Triplebyte what caused them to have bad experiences during onsite interviews. Almost all the
replies centered on their interactions with the interviewers. The top three complaints were interviewers being (1)
unprepared and not knowing anything about them (2) not being familiar with the technical questions they asked and (3)
being determined to prove their intelligence to the interviewee.

It's unlikely an engineer will accept your offer if they had a bad interaction with an interviewer. I'd make the
importance of providing a good interview experience a part of your company culture. You can start by writing a simple
interviewing guide for your team that emphasizes the importance of being on-time, prepared and friendly when
interviewing. You can also only pick the engineers who are friendliest and best at representing your company as
interviewers.

For question familiarity, have a centralized question bank that interviewers work through together before using them on
candidates. For more ideas on the kind of content and questions you can use in technical interviews, my co-founder Ammon
wrote a detailed post on [how to interview engineers](https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-interview-engineers).

It's also great to do something that makes lunch a chance for the candidate to get to know the team. At Triplebyte we
Slack our team in the morning that a candidate is interviewing and ask people to head over to the lunch table at the
same time. Our office manager introduces the candidate to the team and we do an icebreaker where the candidate gets to
ask a question which everyone goes around and answers (we tell them to think of this ahead of time and make it
lighthearted). It's a good way for them to get to know the team and is usually quite fun. We've had candidates tell us
this experience was the deciding factor in joining.

## Making The Offer

After a successful onsite you'll make the formal offer and the work to get it accepted really starts. The first step is
making sure you actually present the offer details. A complaint we hear from Triplebyte candidates is being asked how
likely they would be to accept an offer before knowing the actual offer details. The reality is that compensation
details are a large factor in where people decide to work and you can't expect someone to know if they want to work for
you without giving them that data.

Create a formal offer letter template that includes these details:

  - Salary and benefits
  - Signing bonus details (if applicable)
  - Health insurance details (include a link to the policy documents)
  - 401(k) details, if any
  - Vacation policy details

Equity

  - Total number of shares/stock options presented
  - Total number of shares outstanding
  - % ownership that represents
  - Exercise price for options
  - Vesting schedule details

When presenting the offer I'd recommend doing things in the following order:

Step One: Call to tell them they'll be receiving an offer

Have the hiring manager (if you're early stage that's the founder) call the candidate as soon as possible after the
onsite. Do it the same day if you can. Tell them the day went really well and you'd love to make them an offer to join
the team. Mention specific reasons why you're excited about them joining the team and reference what they did well
during the day. You could even have multiple people on the call and ask each of them to mention a specific reason they'd
be excited to work with the candidate. Tell them the next step will be you (or a recruiter) calling them back to talk
through offer details.

Step Two: Call with offer details

Call the next day to talk them through the offer details. Explaining salary and benefits is fairly straightforward. For
equity, before giving any details, ask them how familiar they are with equity concepts like stock options or RSUs.

  - If they have little familiarity, do not overwhelm them with information on the call. Give them a quick explanation
    of how equity works. Talk them through the numbers of your offer and tell them you'll send them some resources on
    equity to read through on their own time.
  - If they're experienced with equity, then go straight into the numbers and ask if they have any questions about the
    details they'd like you to talk more about.

Tell them you'll be sending through the formal offer letter, documenting all these details, via email shortly. They
should take some time to digest that and the next step would be a follow up call to talk through their thoughts. Offer
some times for that call right then.

It's tempting to push hard for a decision on this call. I'd recommend not doing that to avoid the candidate feeling
pressured. This will make it harder for you to stay engaged with them as they go through the decision making process.
It's fine to ask them if they have any initial thoughts or questions and then move on if they seem hesitant to go into
details. It is also ok to ask them about their decision making timeline if you haven't discussed that already.

## Culture

Now the offer has been presented it's time to focus on closing. To be effective at closing candidates you need to work
hard at selling them on the most exciting reasons to join. This sounds obvious but there is a temptation to stop if the
candidate doesn't seem immediately excited or asks probing questions about your business. The reality is that working at
your company will seem more exciting to you than the candidate because you've had time and data to build up that
excitement. Now you have to pull out all the stops to transfer that excitement.

It's common at this stage for candidates to start probing more deeply into questions about your company culture. They're
trying to build a picture of what it will be like to work with you on a daily basis. We've observed at Triplebyte that
most companies use fairly generic descriptions of their culture. This is optimal for not offending candidates but won't
make your company stand out. To use your culture as a differentiator you'll need to take some risk. You could try
describing your culture with tradeoffs e.g. don't just say you're ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù, say you're willing to trade the
upside of collaboration (better ideas and execution) for the downsides (reduced personal autonomy to just do things).

Depending on the content you choose, being different in describing your culture could backfire or it could give you a
hiring advantage with the right candidates. Whichever approach you take, make sure you and your team are prepared to
talk in detail about this with candidates. Sounding unprepared about culture is itself a negative signal about how much
the company cares about and values its team.

## Closing

Make sure to get your team involved in the closing process. Ask everyone who met the candidate during the onsite to send
them a follow up email with specific reasons they enjoyed it and offering to talk with them again. If you're small it's
ok if this is literally the entire company. If you have multiple teams and you already know which team the candidate
would be working on, make sure that team reaches out. Encourage them to talk about the details of what the first two
weeks would look like and who would help get them ramped up. Nitty gritty details will make the offer feel more real and
we've seen this be the deciding factor for candidates.

If you're early stage, include your investors in every engineering offer you make. Then become selective as you grow and
the hiring pace picks up. Choose the investor you think will be most likely to effectively sell that candidate and give
the candidate context on why you thought that in the intro email. Don't pick an investor who isn't up to date and
familiar with the details about your company.

Also think about more than just closing the candidate. Think about their personal circumstances and other decision
makers involved. The best recruiters we work with at Triplebyte are continually taking notes about this and referring
back to them to take action. I've seen a great recruiter learn early on that the candidate's wife was reluctant to move
location because she was worried it'd negatively impact her medical career. The recruiter spent time researching places
she could work, gathered contact information and compensation data, and asked to speak with the wife to share it. The
candidate accepted the offer shortly afterwards.

What matters most during the closing process is how long its been since your last communication with the candidate. You
need to strike a balance between proactively following up without being overbearing. It's good to find reasons to reach
out again that aren't asking ‚Äúhave you decided yet?‚Äù even if you both know what the real agenda is. For example you
could send them links to recent news stories you think they'd be interested in based on what you learnt about them
during the onsite. If you're doing team events send them an invitation to join. Your goal is to stay near the top of
their mind as they're deciding but not suffocate them.

## Exploding Offers

One tactic companies use for closing is putting an aggressive deadline on the offer e.g. we need a final decision within
a week. I'd advise against this because good candidates with multiple options will push back. It's also something an
experienced recruiter at a competing company can use as ammunition against you. If a candidate tells them about your
deadline they might respond well I'd question the culture that company is trying to build if they only want to hire
people who can decide quickly. We want everyone to be sure this is the best place for them over the long term and would
never pressure someone into rushing their decision.

A softer version you can try is an expiring signing bonus. We've seen this be effective and have used it ourselves with
success at Triplebyte. The way I'd present this would be We want you to take all the time you need to make the right
decision for you (and your family). At the same time we can't leave offers hanging out there indefinitely as things can
change rapidly at a startup. If you are able to make a final decision by X date, we'd be able to offer you a $X,000
signing bonus.

## Big Company Competition and Bay Area Relocation

There are two common scenarios that present unique closing challenges - competing against big companies (Facebook and
Google especially) and candidates considering relocation to the Bay Area. I'll talk through some advice on handling
both.

As a startup it's hard to compete with Facebook and Google compensation packages, especially for senior engineers.
Unless you're also a public company, you won't be able to compete on total compensation. Still, you can win - we've seen
startups successfully compete against them on Triplebyte. These are the arguments we've found are most successful:

1.  *Learning*: You learn the fastest by being given real decision making responsibility. Large companies won't give you
    this kind of responsibility for years, they need to have checks and balances in place to ensure no single person -
    especially a new hire - could cause too much damage. Fast growing startups don't have this luxury and you'll be
    thrown straight into making decisions that could materially affect the trajectory of the company.
2.  *Career Progression*: Silicon Valley and the technology industry are unique because you can rise up through the
    ranks of a company faster than anywhere else (e.g. the Chief Product Officer of Facebook ($500bn market cap) is 36
    years old). This only happens by joining a startup that grows fast and keeps throwing more responsibilities at you.
    Give the candidate examples of how this has already been happening for people at your startup and paint a specific
    picture of how the candidate could progress over the next few years with you.
3.  *Opportunity cost*: At any point in time there will always be the safe option of working at a public technology
    company. The names might change but the experience of working at one is fungible. The experience of working at
    startups can vary wildly and you should present your startup as a unique opportunity right now because of the team
    and market. They can always go back to the big company experience if it doesn't work out.
4.  *Mentorship*: One concern engineers, especially juniors, can have about working at a smaller startup is they won't
    learn best practices and the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do things. It will help a lot if you have experienced engineers on your
    team who would be willing to provide mentorship. If you do be sure to tell the candidate this.

For candidates who would need to relocate to the Bay Area, they may be frightened by the cost of living, which has both
increased in dollars and frequency of press coverage. While this is ultimately a personal decision for the candidate I
have been surprised by how often even engineers don't take an analytical approach to running the numbers to be sure what
their actual cost of living would be. You can be proactive about this. Don't assume that when a candidate says they
don't think they can afford to live in the Bay Area that they've run through the numbers. If you really want them to
join then spend time helping them think through this. You can create a spreadsheet template with cost of living
assumptions and work through this together with them to figure out what their real monthly income would be. We also
wrote a [blog post](https://triplebyte.com/blog/does-it-make-sense-for-programmers-to-move-to-the-bay-area) talking
through the pros and cons in detail that you could share.

## Feedback and Iterate

No company has a 100% offer acceptance rate and you will inevitably miss out on closing candidates you really wanted.
That's an inevitable part of hiring and it sucks. Use every rejected offer as an opportunity to gather data on how you
can improve your hiring process and pitch. Do a quick exit interview with each candidate and ask for feedback on why
they made the decision and their general feedback on the quality of your hiring process. Review these regularly with
your team and use them to iterate and improve your interviewing and closing process over time.

If you treat optimizing this process like you would optimizing your product you will see improved conversions and have
more success hiring. Good luck\!

**Nick Raushenbush, Shogun**: Here are the tools that we use on a daily basis:

  - [Slack:](https://slack.com/lp/three?utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-hv-exp-email&utm_term=slack&ds_rl=1249094&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1-y47umn6AIVEv5kCh3s-g5qEAAYASAAEgLNAfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    For communication that is fast moving and somewhat ephemeral.
  - [Ally.io:](https://www.ally.io/) For objectives and key results (OKRs); quantitative goals are really important when
    it comes to remote teams and should be a team member's northstar.
  - [Notion.so:](https://www.notion.so/) For permanent information, like our company's wiki/ knowledge base.
  - [Zoom:](https://zoom.us/) For synchronous communication.
  - [Donut:](https://www.donut.com/) For onboarding and remote socialization; Donut integrates well with Slack.
  - [CloudApp:](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) For communicating in annotated screenshots GIFs, and short videos.
    Sometimes a written explanation doesn‚Äôt suffice, but it‚Äôs not quite worth a call.
  - [360 Learning:](https://360learning.com/) For scaling knowledge for business development and support; this tool
    enables you to create videos, turn transcriptions into written posts, create quizzes and peer-to-peer learning
    programs. [Lessonly](https://www.lessonly.com/) is a good alternative as well.
  - [Rev](https://www.rev.com/): For transcribing video or voice into text. Much of remote communication is
    asynchronous; this is a nice hack for creating written content and transcribing meetings.
  - [Loom:](https://www.loom.com/) For video recording communications, creating tutorials, trainings, etc.

## **Question: I have a lot of experience working remotely, and I‚Äôm looking for a job. How do I find a remote position?**

  - [Gitlab‚Äôs List of Remote Companies: All-Remote and Remote-First
    Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/jobs/)
  - [2,500 Startups Hiring Remotely in 2020](https://blog.remotive.io/2-500-companies-hiring-remotely-in-2020/)
  - [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/)
  - [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)

## **Question: What is the right cadence of check-ins? Not just for my executive team but for managers and their teams?**

**Wade Foster, Zapier**: I'd keep in mind task relevant maturity (a concept from [Andy Grove's book High Output
Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)). When someone is good at
something, you can go longer without check-ins. When someone is new to something you probably want more frequent
check-ins. If my team was new to remote, I'd probably start with an AM and a PM check-in; then as we get more
comfortable and have less frequent blockers, I'd scale the check-ins back.

What we do at Zapier:

  - Weekly: 1:1s, Staff Meetings and All Hands
  - Monthly: OKR Reviews, OKR Planning

**Ian Tien, Mattermost**: If your team is international and across multiple time zones, here is a detailed
[handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence) outlining how to approach company wide
communication. To start off, it is important to record meetings and take anonymous Q\&A feedback asynchronously, so if
someone is not able to attend they are still on equal footing to interact.

**Nick Raushenbush, Shogun**: When we were a smaller team we relied on ad hoc communication a lot more. Now we are more
thoughtful with meeting structure. Monthly: Company-wide AMAs are a new thing, but so far we really like them. We‚Äôre
planning for once a month but might drop to once a quarter based on feedback. Weekly: Team fireside chats for 30
minutes.

During meetings and check-ins I always ask:

  - How are you doing and feeling this week?
  - What are your blockers?
  - What can I do to empower you to hit your goals?
  - Do you need time, budget, human resources?
  - Do you see any systemic issues/problems with how the company or product are functioning?
  - Any questions for me?

## **Question: What do you do to keep culture alive when fully virtual and remote?**

**Ben Congleton, [Olark](https://www.olark.com/)**: It starts with empowering your team to have space to think about the
culture and values they want to present. Here are guides that we put together:

  - [Remote Office Parties](https://blog.olark.com/ultimate-guide-to-remote-office-parties)
  - [Creating Watercooler Moments](https://blog.olark.com/creating-remote-watercooler-moments)
  - [All Hands Retreat](https://blog.olark.com/what-is-the-olark-retreat)

**Rajiv Ayyangar, Tandem**: We interviewed 100 remote teams and wrote a rundown of tactics for building trust: [How to
Build Psychological Safety in your Remote
Team.](https://medium.com/tandem/how-to-build-psychological-safety-in-your-remote-team-part-i-d8fbb0ef7dc7)

**Nick Raushenbush, Shogun**: Culture forms\! [Donut](https://www.donut.com/) is a great tool to introduce team members
to each other.

## **Question: We all know tools are important for remote work? How do you get people to actually use them?**

**Darren Murph, GitLab**: If you‚Äôre forced to be remote, [minimize your tool
stack](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-emergency-plan/#minimize-your-tool-stack.);
minimize the chaos. It‚Äôs a lot for people thrust into remote areas, so if you can avoid introducing a new tool at the
same time, avoid that. If you must do it, create documentation first, so the tool roll-out happens only after people
have read, end-to-end, why you‚Äôre doing it, how they‚Äôll use it, what it replaces, etc. Documentation is critical to
adoption.

**Ben Congleton, Olark**: It is important to recognize that some business tools are critical while others are
elective.The only tools that are company wide requirements are based on job function and team needs. For example,
expectations are set around using Slack, Google Docs, Google Calendar and Zoom. Letting teams choose platforms and make
tool decisions helps and benefits them directly.

**Wade Foster, Zapier**: We don't enforce tool usage all that tightly outside of Slack and Zoom. What we do have is
expectations on reporting. So if you reported to me, we'd agree on output at the beginning of the week, and at the end
of the week, you communicate the result. The tools are a means to get to that ‚Äî use whatever helps you get it done.

## **Question: What is the most important rule to follow as a remote team?**

**Yura Riphyak, [YouTeam](https://youteam.io/)**:It is extremely important to put everything in writing. Three reasons
why:

1.  The written form disciplines thought and forces you to keep it short.
2.  All communication gets saved with no extra effort. This proves vital in case you need to involve more stakeholders
    in the future or revisit decisions that have been made.
3.  Textual content is searchable. Yes, you can record Zoom meetings ‚Äî but how many of those recordings will you
    actually watch?

## **Question: What do you think about increasing peer 1:1 interactions?**

**For example:**

  - **When assigning a project, the manager also assigns a peer to discuss/help at the start, middle, and end of the
    project (vs full pair programming/working).**
  - **Encourage people to post office hours and list topics they'd like to help others do or learn.** - **Encourage or
    facilitate video chat amongst peers.**

**Yura Riphyak, YouTeam**: Like most of the other things about non-work communication, we are trying to be light on any
kind of management-induced activities. This stuff should happen bottom-up, not top-down. People who work remotely
develop a comparatively high level of self-sufficiency and also a strong sense of personal space. One thing we are doing
is making sure everyone knows about the others' hobbies and interests. For example, we have a chess group, skiing group,
and book club.

**Rajiv Ayyangar, Tandem**: At Tandem, we built rooms to allow for a virtual water cooler. Social proof (seeing that
other people are talking) is a huge factor in whether teammates are willing to talk socially. A few factors that one
could consider: Fun\! If there's a fun reason to talk, like a game you want to try or an icebreaker topic, that can
help. Inviting vs. demanding. If you let people know you have office hours, or will be in a room/call during X-Y time,
then it's an invitation. If you say you'll be video-calling random people, it's demanding.

that what we learn along the way shouldn‚Äôt just be kept inside of YC. We're going to publish tools and learnings from
the program that should help every company create better outcomes.

This is the first tool. It‚Äôs simple, but effective.

Below, you‚Äôll find a Series A diligence checklist. This runs through all the pieces of information you‚Äôll need to have
ready once you sign a term sheet. Having all of this together in one place - a Data Room - before you sign a term sheet
will cut as much as a week off of your closing process. Founders don‚Äôt generally realize that closing an A can take more
than a month, much of which is often spent tracking down documents for lawyers.

Jason Kwon, the GC of YC Continuity put this checklist together after being involved in hundreds of financings with
nearly every law firm and VC fund in the valley.

**Equity Grants**  
If you have any pending or promised equity grants you haven't already taken care of before you start your Series A
process, do that ASAP. More people than not believe that once you have a term sheet, you can no longer use your
current 409A valuation for option/stock grants because a material event has occurred that implies a newer (and hopefully
higher) valuation for the company's common stock. Team members that were hired earlier who haven't been granted their
equity yet will then have to receive their equity at a higher strike price, which reduces their upside. Some hires will
realize this and you may then have to increase their compensation (in equity, cash or both) to make up the difference to
avoid a morale issue. Since you cannot control the exact timing of when you receive a term sheet, the prudent thing to
do is to make sure there isn't a significant backlog of equity grants while you are in the middle of your fundraise
process.

Since this video was created, we've launched [YC Co-Founder Matching](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching).
The advice in this video is still correct -- if you have an existing network to search for co-founders, that's a great
place to look for a match. But many founders have also found success with our co-founder matching service, so we now
recommend you try that in parallel.

-----

There seem to be many founders who can‚Äôt launch because they don‚Äôt have the strong technical skills to build what they
want to build and don‚Äôt know how to find a technical co-founder. So we wanted to offer some advice.

First, are *you* technical enough? It really depends on what you‚Äôre building. If you‚Äôre developing new cancer drugs, you
better be quite technical with biology. But if you‚Äôre building an iPhone app or website, you probably don‚Äôt have to be
that technical to build the first version.

For example, watch [Avni Patel Thompson‚Äôs
talk](https://blog.ycombinator.com/building-a-startup-is-not-about-building-a-product-its-about-solving-a-problem-avni-patel-thompson-of-poppy/),
specifically the part on how she built and launched Poppy before she was able to convince a programmer to join her. You
should think of all the ways you can patch together an MVP with existing non-coder tools, launch and get some users. At
this point, it‚Äôs much easier to convince and get someone technical excited to join you vs when you just have an idea.

If you can‚Äôt find a way like Avni did, then consider the following:

1.  You first need to understand how important it is to have a technical co-founder. How much faster you can go, and
    thus have runway to iterate to product market fit. And regardless what you think, know that if you plan to
    fundraise, any investor will think this.
2.  Make a list of everyone you know from high school, college and workplace. Who from there knows how to write code and
    actually enjoys it? Note that just because they‚Äôre a CTO or manage engineers, it doesn‚Äôt mean they enjoy writing
    code.Then figure out if you can work with any of them. Start spending more time with them, e.g. working on a fun
    side project together. It doesn‚Äôt have to involve coding; just something that builds confidence that you can work
    well together. Finally, figure out a real offer to give them, which includes salary + equity. Then pitch them your
    real offer, and make them say ‚Äòno‚Äô to you (or ideally ‚Äòyes‚Äô). Don‚Äôt do the ambiguous dance a lot of people do. Make
    a firm offer. If you don‚Äôt have money for salary and/or that person has no outside commitments requiring salary,
    then propose 50/50 equity split.
3.  If you can‚Äôt think of anyone, then consider how much harder it is to do a tech startup without a strong technical
    co-founder and succeed. Instead of struggling for two years, it might make more sense to spend some time in industry
    for two years and find your technical co-founder during this time. Tradeoff struggling today for much higher success
    tomorrow.One way to do this is to find companies with strong engineering cultures (nothing outsourced, etc). Then
    email the CEO and tell her/him why you‚Äôre passionate about working at their company and offer to do anything to help
    whether it‚Äôs customer service, bizops, or whatever schlep work is available. And say - if it doesn‚Äôt work out
    after 3 months, then just fire me. The point is to leverage the opportunity - no matter what role you get - to
    become friends with engineers and figure out if you‚Äôre compatible them (same process as above). In fact, you
    shouldn‚Äôt care what your role is; this isn‚Äôt for resume building.

Lastly, when you identify the right person. Instead of pitching them directly your idea. Brainstorm ideas with that
person so it evolves with the both of you. This will be a good start to a hopefully lasting relationship of building
together.

In a startup culture that is obsessed with management by metrics, many founders struggle to answer this critical
question about themselves. It‚Äôs tempting to measure leaders simply by the success of their businesses. But even the most
successful founders know how much timing and luck can be confounding factors in this approach. Measuring leadership
through bottom-line company performance also fails to provide any clues as to how someone can improve as a leader. So is
there a better way?

This essay describes a way to measure leadership that I hope will be helpful to those who seek to improve as leaders. It
is based on observations I made when working closely with four leaders that I consider extraordinary: Ed Catmull
(Pixar‚Äôs founder), Steve Jobs (Pixar‚Äôs CEO), John Lasseter (Pixar‚Äôs Chief Creative Officer), and Bob Iger (Disney‚Äôs
CEO). To my surprise, these men could not have been more different in style, temperament, and approach. They did not
conform to a single model of leadership. One was an introverted scientist while another was an extroverted artist. One
was a college dropout who had founded a company and was infamous for brash behavior while another was a career executive
who was exceptionally genteel and diplomatic.

Despite their differences, these men were able to create an extraordinary amount of trust in the people around them.
They built trust by doing the same three things exceptionally well, though each in his own way. I believe that these
three traits are the foundational traits of great leaders You cannot be a great leader without them because you cannot
build trust without them. And the trick to measuring leadership is to measure a leader‚Äôs effectiveness along these three
dimensions, as detailed in the notes section [at the end of this
post](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-do-you-measure-leadership/#survey-questions).

### Three Foundational Characteristics of Great Leaders

I believe that people of all temperaments, personality types, and personal/professional backgrounds can be great
leaders, and that they can lead quite differently and still be successful. But to be trusted and followed as a leader,
you must excel in three key areas:

**1. Clarity of Thought and Communication**

Great leaders think and communicate clearly. They describe a vision of the future that people find compelling to work
hard to achieve. If your employees are confused about your mission and strategy, or do not find it motivating or
credible, they will not follow you with the focus and determination necessary to
succeed.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

Clarity of thought always precedes clarity of language. To improve your communication, the best thing you can do is to
spend more time thinking about what you believe is truly important for your business. Once you‚Äôve crystallized what‚Äôs
important for everyone to understand, practice expressing it in simple terms. Simplicity is vital. A great example is
the retail strategy that Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos
[communicated](http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-brilliant-advice-for-anyone-running-a-business-2015-1) to his
team years ago. He based it on three simple but enduring customer preferences: lower prices, bigger selection, and
faster delivery. To this day, anything Amazon employees do to lower prices, expand selection, and accelerate delivery
creates value for the customer and advances the company‚Äôs strategy. As Bezos said, ‚ÄúYou can build a business strategy
around the things that are stable in time....when you have something that you know is true, even over the long-term, you
can afford to put a lot of energy into it.‚Äù

Taking time to prepare internal communications becomes increasingly important as your company grows. As you scale, your
employee base grows more diverse, and fewer of your employees have a personal relationship with you. Hence, they are
much less likely to just ‚Äúknow what you mean‚Äù and more likely to be confused and critical if you don‚Äôt communicate well.

Great leaders spend hours preparing their internal communications. They don‚Äôt just wing it, no matter how naturally
talented they are as communicators. As an example, Shopify CEO Tobi L√ºtke and his senior team spend hundreds of hours
preparing for their annual employee Summit. As Tobi says, ‚ÄúWe want to be a loosely coupled, highly aligned company. The
Summit is the main enabler of this because it is a grand sync. We spend countless hours preparing because if we
communicate well at the Summit, we achieve great alignment by the end. We can then use our weekly townhalls to keep us
from drifting too far apart until the next Summit.‚Äù

**2. Judgment about People**

Great leaders have great intuition about people, particularly when it comes to selecting people to whom they give power
and responsibility. They are able to see hidden potential in people and detect cases where ambition exceeds ability. And
when they make hiring or promotion mistakes, which are inevitable, they have the courage to rectify the situation if the
employee cannot be coached to improve. Nothing does more damage to an organization or to the standing of a leader than
picking the wrong leaders or failing to correct these mistakes when they happen. The judgment around the initial hiring
or promotion decision is the most important, as leaders who fire too many of their own also lose a lot of credibility
and trust.

Not everyone is naturally gifted when it comes to intuition about people, but everyone can improve. Gathering more data
will help you make better people decisions. When looking to hire leaders, try to meet as many of the best people in the
field as possible as a way to sharpen your recognition skills. Spend as much time as you can getting to know executives
that you are considering hiring. In a [2016 interview](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/qa-uber-cto/), Uber CTO Thuan Pham
describes being interviewed by CEO Travis Kalanick for ‚Äú30 hours straight, one-on-one, over two weeks,‚Äù including over
Skype when Travis was traveling. ‚ÄúThroughout those 30 hours,‚Äù Pham continued, ‚ÄúI actually forgot it was an interview. It
was just like a discussion between two colleagues.‚Äù

It also helps to do extensive reference checks on hires and ask for examples of behavior that shows good judgment and
high integrity because these traits are hard to test in an interview. And try to learn from cases when you hire or
promote the wrong person and are not able to coach them to improve.

**3. Personal Integrity and Commitment**

Great leaders have exceptional personal integrity and commitment to their mission. Integrity means standing for
something meaningful beyond oneself rather than being motivated by narrow personal interests. It means being able to
admit when you have made a mistake rather than acting like you are always right and having the humility to receive
critical feedback openly and work to improve. It means avoiding behavior like favoritism, conflicts of interest,
inappropriate language, inappropriate work relationships, etc., that erode trust. A useful test is to ask yourself: if
your team had full transparency into your private communications and behavior towards employees, would you be
embarrassed by anything you have done or said? This is a high bar, but one that great leaders strive to meet.

Beyond putting in the time, great leaders make their work into their core life mission in ways that inspire others. They
derive deep personal meaning and fulfillment from leading people to achieve a mission. Their personal commitment
translates into high levels of personal productivity and execution, which in turn becomes the foundation for pushing
their organizations to do the same.

### It All Adds Up To Trust

So how do you know you are good leader? You are a good leader if you excel in the three areas described above and
thereby earn the trust of the people around you.

Building trust in this way is both a science and an art; it requires both competence and character. Trust is built when
leaders think clearly about the future and move their organizations to the right place, in terms of product, sales, and
people. Do the predictions you make about the future ‚Äì about the products you should build, the investments you should
make, and the changes in competitive or technological landscape ‚Äì prove to be accurate? And do the people you have
chosen to lead in your organization prove to be the right ones? Over time, the answers to these questions become known,
and if you answer a lot of these questions correctly, you earn trust. I consider this the ‚Äúscience‚Äù of building trust.
It‚Äôs built on clarity of thought, good communication, and good judgment about people.

The art of building trust is more complicated. It is closely tied with a leader‚Äôs ability to communicate with integrity.
It is built when you say the right thing at the right time, and show empathy and good judgment. It grows when you stand
for ideals bigger than yourself rather than caring primarily about your personal success, wealth, fame, or position. It
also grows when you are honest with others, admitting what you don‚Äôt know, and not trying to be someone else. This is
why you can‚Äôt try to copy Steve Jobs or Ed Catmull in your quest to be a great leader. You can only be yourself.

Most leaders understand the science of building trust. They understand that they need to think and communicate clearly
about product and strategy and make good choices when they are hiring and promoting people into leadership positions.
They understand that they have to show deep commitment and get things done. But in my experience, the truly great
leaders also understand the art of building trust. Leaders have to make many hard decisions ‚Äì firing people, taking
responsibility for mistakes, disappointing people by saying no, etc. Great leaders treat these challenges as
opportunities to build trust. They ask themselves which course of action and which style of communication will increase
the trust that employees have in them. When faced with a difficult challenge, they optimize for trust.

This, perhaps, is the lesson that great leaders teach everyone else. In difficult times, as you evaluate one course of
action versus another, ask yourself which path will generate more trust in you as a person and as a leader. Always try
to choose that path.

**NOTES:**

<span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Survey Questions for Evaluating Leaders</strong></span>

<span style="color: #888888;">The best approach to measuring leadership is to evaluate a leader‚Äôs performance in the
three areas in which all great leaders must excel: clarity of thought / communication, judgment about people, and
personal integrity / commitment. Measuring leadership in this way requires gathering data from employees, but most
startups have never done this in a systematic way.</span>

<span style="color: #888888;">Eventually, all companies need to develop methods to gather employee sentiment and turn it
into structured data. In fact one of the core responsibilities of a good HR team is to gather and document employee
sentiment and use it to assess leadership.<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> I suggest that startups
begin to gather this data systematically once they reach about 50 people in size.</span>

<span style="color: #888888;">Whatever set of data gathering techniques is used, it‚Äôs critical to ask the right
questions to assess leadership performance. These sample questions are meant to serve as a starting point for a more
thorough employee survey. These questions are written to evaluate a CEO, but can easily be adapted to any leader in the
company. Part of the goal is to see the level of alignment between a CEO‚Äôs responses and that of the employees.</span>

phase. A CEO‚Äôs first job is to build a product users love; the second job is to build a company to maximize the
opportunity that the product has surfaced; and the third is to harvest the profits of the core business to invest in
transformative new product ideas. This blog post describes how to become a great Phase 2 CEO by focusing on the highest
leverage tasks that only the CEO can accomplish. As YC‚Äôs Continuity team, we‚Äôve seen many Phase 1 CEOs transition
successfully into Phase 2, and some who have not. The future of your startup depends on which kind you are.

**Your First Creation is a Product, Your Second Creation is a Company**

A CEO‚Äôs first job is to build a great product and find a small group of people who love it and use it
enthusiastically.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> A Phase 1 startup CEO is the Doer-in-Chief. You
must be deeply involved in both building the product (observing/interacting with users, writing code, designing product
specs) and acquiring users/customers. Delegation should not be a word in your vocabulary. If you succeed, it‚Äôs because
your deep involvement and unique vision give the company a perspective and drive that few others have. The other
imperative for a Phase 1 CEO is to conserve money in order to extend the time to iterate and improve the product.

Most startups fail because they are not able to create a product that users love enough to abandon existing
alternatives. Success in this first phase means discovering more demand for your product than your small team can
handle. When this happens, you have to shift your focus as CEO to building a company that can capture and maximize the
demand that your product has surfaced. Company-building becomes the CEO‚Äôs primary job in a Phase 2 startup. The company
you build is your second creation and will be your lasting legacy as a founder.

As a Phase 2 CEO, you need to transition from ‚ÄúDoer-in-Chief‚Äù to ‚ÄúCompany-Builder-in-Chief.‚Äù This is how you scale as a
CEO, and CEO scaling is the first step in company-building. For most founders, this is very difficult. When you‚Äôve been
a successful Doer-in-Chief, it‚Äôs hard to stop. It‚Äôs hard to stop coding, designing product specs, and interacting with
customers on a daily basis. It‚Äôs hard to stop answering support tickets, doing all the product demos, and debugging the
latest build. It‚Äôs even hard to delegate the random and sometimes menial tasks that you‚Äôve accumulated over the years
because they were ‚Äúno one‚Äôs job.‚Äù But you have to stop doing all of these things so that you can safeguard your time for
high leverage tasks that only CEOs can do.

This transition can cause confusion and even friction with your team, who can suddenly wonder what you are doing if
you‚Äôre no longer committing code or why you‚Äôre suddenly delegating a bunch of menial tasks that you‚Äôd been doing for
years. But once your startup reaches 20-30 people, you‚Äôll have to spend more time leading (i.e., directing the
activities of others). And since time is finite, the only way to lead more is do less. Without delegating, you simply
won‚Äôt have time to focus on company-building and you‚Äôll end up slowing everyone else down.

It may seem impossible at first, but you can eventually delegate day-to-day responsibility for everything you did in
Phase 1, even Product. You obviously can‚Äôt drop everything overnight, but your job is to replace yourself by hiring
people better than you into leadership positions. As David Rusenko, the co-founder and CEO of Weebly has said, ‚ÄúOften,
the first time I find out about a product feature is reading about it on our blog. It shocks most founders to hear this,
but I know I‚Äôve done my job well because I‚Äôve yet to see a feature that was built poorly. You should aspire to build a
team that‚Äôs so good that you don‚Äôt have to be involved in the product details.‚Äù

In practice, Phase 2 usually begins when a startup has around 20-25 employees and ends when it reaches 400-500
employees. At the end of Phase 2, you‚Äôll have a leadership team that you‚Äôve ‚Äúroad tested‚Äù to the point that you can
confidently delegate everything you did in Phase 1. Your direct reports should be experienced leaders who can perform at
a high level with minimal involvement from you, provided that you have set direction well. You can then shift the burden
of company building to your leadership team so that you can start working on Phase 3: taking profits from the core
business and investing them in new, transformative products. As an example, Facebook built its senior management team in
Phase 2 while running the business at roughly breakeven. In Phase 3, it began to generate huge profits in its core
business thanks to more lucrative in-stream ads, so it could allocate significant resources towards Messenger as a
separate product and buy Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus.

**Three Tasks That CEOs Can‚Äôt Delegate**

Stated simply, your job as a Phase 2 startup CEO is to delegate everything you did in Phase 1 in order to create time to
focus on three critical operational tasks that only the CEO can do
<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>:

**1. Hiring a Leadership Team and Making Sure They Work Well Together**

Only the CEO can hire the company‚Äôs senior leadership team and make sure that they work well together. You can get help
and feedback from others as you hire, but when you bring leaders like a VP of Engineering, VP of Sales, and CFO on
board, the ultimate hiring decisions must be yours. You can‚Äôt hire by compromise, looking for someone who everyone
around you likes. The choice has to be yours because the consequences are yours as well.

Recruiting senior executives takes an extraordinary amount of time. If you are doing it for the first time, meet lots of
people so that you can develop good judgment about the skills, experiences, and personality traits that you need.
Patrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of Stripe, made it a point to meet with the ‚Äúbest-in-the-world‚Äù in each field so he
could get a sense of what a great candidate looks like. Because executive hiring takes so much time, you should stage
these hires rather than trying to hire everyone at once. Our recommendation is to hire a good executive search firm to
help you run your first couple of searches. It will cost you an arm and a leg, but if it helps you hire the right
person, it‚Äôs worth every penny.

YC teaches founders to manage their startups using weekly milestones to ensure rapid iteration and progress. That‚Äôs
great for a small company trying to find product-market fit, but it‚Äôs not the way to manage senior executives. You
manage senior people to longer term outputs rather than week-to-week tasks. To do this well, you first have to set the
right quarterly and annual milestones for the company and for each executive. It‚Äôs also your job to acclimate new
executives to the culture of the company. As you build your senior team, expect to spend extra time with new executives
individually and as a team on culture and teamwork. You should insist that new executives take the time to build
relationships across the organization rather than pressuring them to come in and start changing things immediately.

Learning how to evaluate the performance of senior executives is also a challenge, partly because your face-to-face
interactions do not provide much of the information you need. You have to evaluate how well they are building their
organizations, how productive and happy their employees are, and how well they are working with other teams and
executives. You should expect that at least 25% of your leadership hires don‚Äôt work out. For most startup CEOs, it‚Äôs
very difficult to fire their first executive, and most CEOs take too long to do it. But it‚Äôs better to act quickly and
leave a void in the organization than to leave an ineffective senior executive in place for too long. The longer you
leave an under-performing executive in place, the more credibility you lose with everyone else on your team.

Your job is done when your entire leadership team has been hired, you‚Äôve coached them to work well together, and they
can operate at a high level with minimal involvement from you. Don‚Äôt be surprised if 50% of your time goes to hiring and
managing your senior team; it‚Äôs time well spent.

**2. Creating Purpose and Alignment**

The second task that CEOs cannot delegate is creating purpose and alignment at the company. When your startup has less
than 10 people who all sit together, you don‚Äôt need to work very hard to keep people aligned. Everyone can easily hear
what‚Äôs going on, understand how their work fits into the broader goals, and have a say in every decision. Communication
is simple and creating alignment is easy.

But when you start hiring more people, soon in different offices and from broader backgrounds and functions (e.g.,
sales, finance, etc.), creating alignment becomes a lot harder. Your team no longer sits within earshot. You aren‚Äôt able
to interview or even meet everyone who joins the company. And you may not even able to attend employee onboarding
sessions. As an example, there was an 18-month period at Twitter where the company was hiring 50 people per month in
offices all around the world. There was no way the CEO or any one executive could meet everyone who was joining the
company.

As a Phase 1 CEO, you are the lead rower on the boat. But in a Phase 2 startup, your job is no longer to row. Instead,
it‚Äôs to define the purpose of the voyage, set the direction of the boat, and measure the pace and performance of a much
larger number of rowers. In business speak, the CEO‚Äôs job is to define the Mission (purpose), Strategy (direction), and
Metrics (pace and performance). These three elements provide the essential context that a growing company needs to be
able to perform.

One of the best examples of ‚ÄúMission-to-Metrics‚Äù alignment comes from a friend who visited the manufacturing floor at
SpaceX. Seeing a SpaceX employee assembling a large part, he stopped to ask him, ‚ÄúWhat is your job at SpaceX?‚Äù He
answered, ‚ÄúThe mission of SpaceX is to colonize Mars. In order to colonize Mars, we need to build reusable rockets
because it will otherwise be unaffordable for humans to travel to Mars and back. My job is to help design the steering
system that enables our rockets to land back on earth. You‚Äôll know if I‚Äôve succeeded if our rockets land on our platform
in the Atlantic after launch.‚Äù The employee could have simply said he was building a steering system for landing
rockets. Instead, he recited the company‚Äôs entire ‚ÄúMission-to-Metrics‚Äù framework. That is alignment.

Can you define the Mission, Strategy, and Metrics for your startup in a way that‚Äôs clear, simple, and inspiring? Most
Phase 2 CEOs can‚Äôt readily do this. And, when they sit down to define it, they find it harder than they thought. The
diagram below captures the task at hand:

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder.png" alt="Mission-to-Metrics" width="1016" height="981" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097571" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder.png)

Your mission should feel ambitious and permanent. It should find its roots in the reasons you started your company and
should not be something that you change very often. Conversely, you should revisit your product strategy and
go-to-market strategy at least twice per year to make sure they remain relevant and right. There is an enormous amount
of literature about developing business and product strategy. Whatever approach you choose, a simple practice always
seems to help: write it down. In our experience, the CEOs who are most effective in developing and communicating
strategy take the time to write their strategy out, in long form. You don‚Äôt have to go as far as Jeff Bezos and his team
at Amazon do, requiring 6 page memos for every strategic meeting. But writing your ‚ÄúMission-to-Metrics‚Äù framework in
long form will help you be more thorough and catch flaws in your thinking.

Effective metric-setting is also a critical part of a CEO‚Äôs job. A common mistake is to equate key internal metrics with
the business‚Äô most important top line results, like revenue or user growth. This is the wrong approach because top line
results like ‚Äúincrease user growth‚Äù usually aren‚Äôt directly actionable. Instead, you‚Äôve got to dig deeper to understand
what drives top line results and set these drivers as the key internal metrics. Great companies work tirelessly to
understand what drives their growth. Facebook famously discovered that connecting a new user to 10 friends within 14
days correlated with retained usage, so they set ‚Äúnumber of new users with 10 friend connections‚Äù as the key product
metric. You‚Äôve got to be tenacious about learning what drives your top line business results and set those drivers are
your internal metrics. If you don‚Äôt know what drives revenue, customer acquisition, or user growth, you aren‚Äôt likely to
be successful anyway.

Once you‚Äôve written ‚ÄúMission-to-Metrics‚Äù for your startup, and gotten feedback from your leadership and other key
employees, you have to start communicating it to everyone regularly. You have to reiterate the Mission-to-Metrics much
more than what feels reasonable, which may run counter to your instinct to be efficient. Your employees will not
internalize the message unless you communicate it constantly. The real test is not simply whether employees can repeat
it, but whether they can make good decisions in your absence based on the context you have provided.

**3. Nurturing Company Culture**

There are few concepts in company building that are as slippery as culture. Fundamentally, culture is defined by the way
people treat one another in a company -- both the way management treats employees and the way people treat one another.
Culture begins to form on the day the second person joins your startup. How founders and early employees act toward one
another in a startup‚Äôs earliest days sets a cultural tone that can last for many years.

But unlike the other tasks listed above, creating a good culture is not uniquely the CEO‚Äôs job. It is everyone‚Äôs
responsibility. So unlike Mission-to-Metrics, a CEO‚Äôs job is not to go to a quiet room and write up a set of cultural
tenets for everyone to follow. This single-author approach usually fails because the resulting words are often
disconnected from the reality of how the employees as a whole experience the company. Rather than assuming the burden of
sole authorship, CEOs should encourage co-founders and early employees to work together to codify a set of values and
behavioral norms that feel authentic and aspirational to everyone. For culture to be self-enforcing, the values must
resonate with the ways the company has acted in the past. That's how they feel authentic rather than contrived. If you
really want the company to embody a value that does not reflect past behavior, then set an example and get everyone in
leadership to act in that way before you consider calling it a company value.

Pixar provides a helpful example. Like most movie studios, Pixar says that one of its key values is that ‚Äústory comes
first.‚Äù And like most companies, it says that its employees are its most important asset. Pixar‚Äôs employees embrace
these values because they authentically represent the way the company has behaved. The most powerful example dates back
to the making of Toy Story 2 in 1999. With only seven months to go before its scheduled release date, Pixar‚Äôs creative
leadership felt that Toy Story 2 was not working creatively. Disney, Pixar‚Äôs distribution partner, knew that it took 3-4
years to make an animated film. They argued that it was too late to start over and that Pixar should release the film as
is. But Pixar refused, deciding instead to tear up the story and re-write it from scratch. The studio pushed itself to
the brink of collapse to complete the new version of Toy Story 2 on time, and the film was a huge commercial and
critical success. And, when it was completed, the executive team took the extraordinary step of closing the studio for
two entire months to let everyone recuperate.

Ed Catmull calls it the most intense and important period in the studio‚Äôs history: ‚ÄúToy Story 2 defined us. It said that
we couldn‚Äôt be a studio that produced both great work and average work. Everything we made had to be great. We proved to
ourselves that we would never release a film when we were not proud of the story. And we also realized that we had to
take care of our people if we were going to ask such sacrifices from them.‚Äù Nothing expresses the core cultural tenets
of Pixar better: Do not compromise creatively and take care of people.

What defines you as a company? You should look to the past to find the answer, often to your earliest days when success
was far from certain. Perhaps it‚Äôs a commitment to quality, like ‚Äústory comes first.‚Äù Perhaps it‚Äôs a mode of working,
like ‚Äúgo fast and break things.‚Äù Once these values have been expressed, the CEO must make sure that the behavior of
every new leader at the company reflects those values. But here too, adherence is not solely the CEO‚Äôs job. Everyone at
the company also has a role to play in holding their leaders, peers, and themselves accountable to the same norms.

**A Simple Measure of Success**

During a management meeting at Pixar, I once heard Steve Jobs say, ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm at my best, 50% of my time is unscheduled.
That‚Äôs the time I use to think, drop in on the people I want to speak with, and let my curiosity roam. It's my time to
be creative. Without this free time, I would never be able to stay ahead of the company. To lead a company, you‚Äôve
always got to be two steps ahead. There‚Äôs no way to lead a company from behind.‚Äù Reaching the point of having a lot of
unscheduled think time is perhaps the clearest sign of success for a Phase 2 CEO. It suggests that you have hired a
leadership team, delegated the day-to-day activities to them, and codified Mission, Strategy, and Metrics well enough
for them to operate effectively without your daily involvement. Your reward is the bounty of time to think and plan the
future of your startup.

companies sign. They‚Äôre the deals upon which the entire life/death/success of the company rely. Founders lie to
themselves by believing that catching a single Big Deal will automatically create a huge company. I've seen this belief
kill a large number of startups.

The possibility of a Big Deal helps founders avoid dealing with other, more pressing issues. When you convince yourself
that all that matters is signing one Big Deal, talking to other customers seems less important. Those customers can't
possibly be important on a relative scale, so they are ignored. At the same time, founders can justify slow progress on
product by claiming that it wouldn't make sense to spend much time on the product without the Big Deal in place, because
that would change everything at once.

Many investors exacerbate this problem by telling founders that they'd absolutely fund them with a huge round, just so
long as the Big Deal was in place. This is a no fault move by the investor because they don't have to take any capital
risk and, in a situation in which the founder does actually land the Big Deal, the investor gets to say ‚ÄúTold you you
could do it\! Here's money\!‚Äù

One of my favorite examples of how a founder avoided relying on a Big Deal while simultaneously benefiting from a number
of them, is how Zach Perret at [Plaid](https://plaid.com) used developers as a revenue base while working on large
contracts with big banks. He knew that Plaid would eventually need to have direct agreements with Banks. He also knew
that those deals would never happen inside of 18-24 months with a small startup. A number of companies I‚Äôve worked with
have turned these bank contracts into the only thing that mattered, and ignored everything else about their businesses
to get them done.

Zach took a different approach. To solve the problem, he started conversations with the banks and simultaneously built a
product that developers would pay for to gain access to bank account information. He used growth and revenue from the
developer side to start building a company that could raise enough money to last long enough to sign his Big Deals. This
works well.

Most founders chasing Big Deals don't do what Zach did. Instead, they ignore incremental revenue or smaller pieces of
progress because it looks insignificant relative to what they believe they will get. What they miss is that progress is
relative. When a company is just starting out, any and all progress is impressive. If that progress is good enough, the
company starts to build momentum which then allows it the time and space to pursue meaningful deals. One of these deals
may even be a Big Deal, but these don't even look that big once they're put into context with the rest of a company's
progress.

One company with which I spent a significant amount of time always seemed to be on the verge of closing its Big Deal.
All the right pieces seemed to be in place, but the final close was always just a bit out of reach. We were all able to
trick ourselves, again and again, into thinking that success was on its way.

Finally, after a year of negotiating, the deal got signed. We thought this was victory, and then discovered something
entirely new. In order to actually deploy the contract there was a whole new set of requirements that were impossible
for the company to meet. The Deal appeared to be done, but in reality, it never had a shot.

In analyzing what went wrong with this and other Big Deals I‚Äôve seen fail, a few things become apparent as to why they
did not work. Fundamentally, there is a mismatch between large companies and small startups that reduce the likelihood
of Big Deals to nearly zero.

First off, large companies have different priorities in pursuing these deals than small startups. The large company
might be interested in the service offered because it will generate revenue or improve efficiency. On the other hand,
the execs might be trying to figure out if your company is any good so that they can buy it. In most cases, the startups
see this Deal as the only thing that matters. That creates mismatched expectations and goals that can‚Äôt be bridged.

Second, large companies have significant processes around doing deals. These processes generally involves an ever
expanding number of parties in different departments, each of which want different things. This can mean that, as a deal
progresses, the startup is forced to convince brand new parties, and build new products to their specifications. Without
a counterbalance, this leads to ever more customization that cannot be re-used which has taken time and money to build.
While the big company can afford to wait, the startup cannot.

I regularly have to remind myself of this logic, because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve bet on incorrectly before, and fear I‚Äôll
keep doing. It‚Äôs so easy to trick yourself into believing that Big Deals are about to happen because the ends would seem
to justify the means.

The only other way I know of consistently landing Big Deals while still a startup is to have some kind of larger unfair
advantage. Founders who have the ability to raise 10s or 100s of millions of dollars off their track record are a good
example of this. Most founders know if this applies to them. If it doesn't apply to you, then you shouldn't bet on it.

I much prefer when founders understand what their real advantages are, and use those advantages to effectively build a
company to the point where a Big Deal is possible. This allows founders to control their own destiny without relying on
outside forces to magically make them huge. Founders should want to be in as much control as possible, and when they
give that control up to chase fantasies, it usually ends badly.

October 2006  
  
(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)  
  
Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a
third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be?  
  
I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school. In
the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get grad students, because all the undergrads were
going to work for startups. I wouldn't be surprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time
they'll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people's.  
  
The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not start a startup while
you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead?  
  
A year and a half ago I gave a [talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html) where I said that the average age of the
founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not undergrads? I'm
glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely a rhetorical one. At the time I couldn't
imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a
biological one. And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn't
undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?  
  
I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex
your life is, you'll find that everyone else, including your family and friends, will discard all the low bits and
regard you as having a single occupation at any given time. If you're in college and have a summer job writing software,
you still read as a student. Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly regarded by everyone
as a programmer.  
  
The problem with starting a startup while you're still in school is that there's a built-in escape hatch. If you start a
startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere,
big deal; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your
occupation is student, and you didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you
graduate, as long as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation.
You're now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.  
  
For nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful motivator of all‚Äîmore powerful even than the
nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. \[1\] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called
Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they've got so far. You might think they wouldn't need any
more motivation. They're working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they're playing
a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You'd think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a
demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity.  
  
Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time.
What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad.  
  
You probably can't change that. Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to; someone who really, truly doesn't care
what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set
up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and
position yourself so they push you in a direction you like.  
  
Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it's a close
call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the
landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. In such a close game, the smallest increase in
the forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into failure.  
  
When we first started [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) we encouraged people to start startups while they were
still in college. That's partly because Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program. We've kept the program shape‚Äîall
of us having dinner together once a week turns out to be a good idea‚Äîbut we've decided now that the party line should be
to tell people to wait till they graduate.  
  
Does that mean you can't start a startup in college? Not at all. Sam Altman, the co-founder of
[Loopt](http://loopt.com/), had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt is probably the most
promising of all the startups we've funded so far. But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy. Within about three minutes of
meeting him, I remember thinking "Ah, so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19."  
  
If it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to? For the same reason that the probably
apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone's playing, would always say they didn't have enough talent
to make it as a pro. Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well as talent, so this answer works out to be the
right advice for everyone. The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and the ones who are sufficiently
determined think "screw that, I'll succeed anyway."  
  
So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can't talk out of it. And frankly, if you're not certain, you
*should* wait. It's not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going to be gone if you don't do it now.
Maybe the window will close on some idea you're working on, but that won't be the last idea you'll have. For every idea
that times out, new ones become feasible. Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased with
time.  
  
In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer? Why not go work for a while, or go to grad school, and then start a
startup? And indeed, that might be a good idea. If I had to pick the sweet spot for startup founders, based on who we're
most excited to see applications from, I'd say it's probably the mid-twenties. Why? What advantages does someone in
their mid-twenties have over someone who's 21? And why isn't it older? What can 25 year olds do that 32 year olds can't?
Those turn out to be questions worth examining.

### **Plus**

If you start a startup soon after college, you'll be a young founder by present standards, so you should know what the
relative advantages of young founders are. They're not what you might think. As a young founder your strengths are:
stamina, poverty, rootlessness, colleagues, and ignorance.  
  
The importance of stamina shouldn't be surprising. If you've heard anything about startups you've probably heard about
the long hours. As far as I can tell these are universal. I can't think of any successful startups whose founders
worked 9 to 5. And it's particularly necessary for younger founders to work long hours because they're probably not as
efficient as they'll be later.  
  
Your second advantage, poverty, might not sound like an advantage, but it is a huge one. Poverty implies you can live
cheaply, and this is critically important for startups. Nearly every startup that fails, fails by running out of money.
It's a little misleading to put it this way, because there's usually some other underlying cause. But regardless of the
source of your problems, a low burn rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them. And since most startups make
all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover from mistakes is a valuable thing to have.  
  
Most startups end up doing something different than they planned. The way the successful ones find something that works
is by trying things that don't. So the worst thing you can do in a startup is to have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and
then start spending a lot of money to implement it. Better to operate cheaply and give your ideas time to evolve.  
  
Recent grads can live on practically nothing, and this gives you an edge over older founders, because the main cost in
software startups is people. The guys with kids and mortgages are at a real disadvantage. This is one reason I'd bet on
the 25 year old over the 32 year old. The 32 year old probably is a better programmer, but probably also has a much more
expensive life. Whereas a 25 year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can live as cheaply as an
undergrad.  
  
Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started Viaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year
olds. We both had roughly zero assets. I would have loved to have a mortgage, since that would have meant I had a
*house*. But in retrospect having nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn't tied down and I was used to living
cheaply.  
  
Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply. One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it
was cheap. The computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripherals like a cassette tape recorder for
data storage and a TV as a monitor. And you know why? Because Woz designed this computer for himself, and he couldn't
afford anything more.  
  
We benefitted from the same phenomenon. Our prices were daringly low for the time. The top level of service was $300 a
month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm. In retrospect this was a smart move, but we didn't do it because
we were smart. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us. Like Apple, we created something inexpensive, and
therefore popular, simply because we were poor.  
  
A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to
cost, and the existing players can't follow because they don't even want to think about a world in which that's
possible. Traditional long distance carriers, for example, didn't even want to think about VoIP. (It was coming, all the
same.) Being poor helps in this game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction technology evolves
in.  
  
The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty. When you're young you're more mobile‚Äînot just because
you don't have a house or much stuff, but also because you're less likely to have serious relationships. This turns out
to be important, because a lot of startups involve someone moving.  
  
The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area to start their next startup. It's a better place for
what they want to do. And it was easy for them to decide to go, because neither as far as I know has a serious
girlfriend, and everything they own will fit in one car‚Äîor more precisely, will either fit in one car or is crappy
enough that they don't mind leaving it behind.  
  
They at least were in Boston. What if they'd been in Nebraska, like Evan Williams was at their age? Someone wrote
recently that the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate. It couldn't be any other way. The
kind of conversations we have with founders, we have to have in person. We fund a dozen startups at a time, and we can't
be in a dozen places at once. But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn't. We wouldn't
be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in Nebraska. Places that aren't [startup
hubs](http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html) are toxic to startups. You can tell that from indirect evidence. You
can tell how hard it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number,
per capita, that succeed there. I don't know exactly what's suppressing all the startups in these towns‚Äîprobably a
hundred subtle little things‚Äîbut something must be. \[2\]  
  
Maybe this will change. Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups will mean they'll be able to survive anywhere,
instead of only in the most hospitable environments. Maybe 37signals is the pattern for the future. But maybe not.
Historically there have always been certain towns that were centers for certain industries, and if you weren't in one of
them you were at a disadvantage. So my guess is that 37signals is an anomaly. We're looking at a pattern much older than
"Web 2.0" here.  
  
Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Area than Miami is simply that there are more founder-type
people there. Successful startups are almost never started by one person. Usually they begin with a conversation in
which someone mentions that something would be a good idea for a company, and his friend says, "Yeah, that is a good
idea, let's try it." If you're missing that second person who says "let's try it," the startup never happens. And that
is another area where undergrads have an edge. They're surrounded by people willing to say that. At a good college
you're concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically minded people‚Äîprobably more concentrated than
you'll ever be again. If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there's a good chance it will hit another nucleus.  
  
The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where can I find a co-founder? That's the biggest problem for
someone starting a startup at 30. When they were in school they knew a lot of good co-founders, but by 30 they've either
lost touch with them or these people are tied down by jobs they don't want to leave.  
  
Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too. Though we were comparatively old, we weren't tied down by impressive jobs. I
was trying to be an artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, though 29, was still in grad school due to a
little interruption in his academic career back in 1988. So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible. Otherwise Robert
would have been a junior professor at that age, and he wouldn't have had time to work on crazy speculative projects with
me.  
  
Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of answer for, but not the co-founder question. There is
no good answer. Co-founders really should be people you already know. And by far the best place to meet them is school.
You have a large sample of smart people; you get to compare how they all perform on identical tasks; and everyone's life
is pretty fluid. A lot of startups grow out of schools for this reason. Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, among others, were
all founded by people who met in school. (In Microsoft's case, it was high school.)  
  
Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experience before they start a company. All other things being
equal, they should. But all other things are not quite as equal as they look. Most students don't realize how rich they
are in the scarcest ingredient in startups, co-founders. If you wait too long, you may find that your friends are now
involved in some project they don't want to abandon. The better they are, the more likely this is to happen.  
  
One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your startup while you're getting those n years of
experience. Sure, go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but get together regularly to scheme, so the
idea of starting a startup stays alive in everyone's brain. I don't know if this works, but it can't hurt to try.  
  
It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as students. Some of your classmates are probably going
to be successful startup founders; at a great technical university, that is a near certainty. So which ones? If I were
you I'd look for the people who are not just smart, but incurable
[builders](http://my-computer.cruftlabs.com:8080/photos/motorcouch/0067.html). Look for the people who keep starting
projects, and finish at least some of them. That's what we look for. Above all else, above academic credentials and even
the idea you apply with, we look for people who build things.  
  
The other place co-founders meet is at work. Fewer do than at school, but there are things you can do to improve the
odds. The most important, obviously, is to work somewhere that has a lot of smart, young people. Another is to work for
a company located in a startup hub. It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quitting with you in a place where
startups are happening all around you.  
  
You might also want to look at the employment agreement you sign when you get hired. Most will say that any ideas you
think of while you're employed by the company belong to them. In practice it's hard for anyone to prove what ideas you
had when, so the line gets drawn at code. If you're going to start a startup, don't write any of the code while you're
still employed. Or at least discard any code you wrote while still employed and start over. It's not so much that your
employer will find out and sue you. It won't come to that; investors or acquirers or (if you're so lucky) underwriters
will nail you first. Between t = 0 and when you buy that yacht, *someone* is going to ask if any of your code legally
belongs to anyone else, and you need to be able to say no. \[3\]  
  
The most overreaching employee agreement I've seen so far is Amazon's. In addition to the usual clauses about owning
your ideas, you also can't be a founder of a startup that has another founder who worked at Amazon‚Äîeven if you didn't
know them or even work there at the same time. I suspect they'd have a hard time enforcing this, but it's a bad sign
they even try. There are plenty of other places to work; you may as well choose one that keeps more of your options
open.  
  
Speaking of cool places to work, there is of course Google. But I notice something slightly frightening about Google:
zero startups come out of there. In that respect it's a black hole. People seem to like working at Google too much to
leave. So if you hope to start a startup one day, the evidence so far suggests you shouldn't work there.  
  
I realize this seems odd advice. If they make your life so good that you don't want to leave, why not work there?
Because, in effect, you're probably getting a local maximum. You need a certain activation energy to start a startup. So
an employer who's fairly pleasant to work for can lull you into staying indefinitely, even if it would be a net win for
you to leave. \[4\]  
  
The best place to work, if you want to start a startup, is probably a startup. In addition to being the right sort of
experience, one way or another it will be over quickly. You'll either end up rich, in which case problem solved, or the
startup will get bought, in which case it it will start to suck to work there and it will be easy to leave, or most
likely, the thing will blow up and you'll be free again.  
  
Your final advantage, ignorance, may not sound very useful. I deliberately used a controversial word for it; you might
equally call it innocence. But it seems to be a powerful force. My Y Combinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just
about to publish a book of [interviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141) with startup founders, and I
noticed a remarkable pattern in them. One after another said that if they'd known how hard it would be, they would have
been too intimidated to start.  
  
Ignorance can be useful when it's a counterweight to other forms of stupidity. It's useful in starting startups because
you're capable of more than you realize. Starting startups is harder than you expect, but you're also capable of more
than you expect, so they balance out.  
  
Most people look at a company like Apple and think, how could I ever make such a thing? Apple is an institution, and I'm
just a person. But every institution was at one point just a handful of people in a room deciding to start something.
Institutions are made up, and made up by people no different from you.  
  
I'm not saying everyone could start a startup. I'm sure most people couldn't; I don't know much about the population at
large. When you get to groups I know well, like hackers, I can say more precisely. At the top schools, I'd guess as many
as a quarter of the CS majors could make it as startup founders if they wanted.  
  
That "if they wanted" is an important qualification‚Äîso important that it's almost cheating to append it like
that‚Äîbecause once you get over a certain threshold of intelligence, which most CS majors at top schools are past, the
deciding factor in whether you succeed as a founder is how much you want to. You don't have to be that smart. If you're
not a genius, just start a startup in some unsexy field where you'll have less competition, like software for human
resources departments. I picked that example at random, but I feel safe in predicting that whatever they have now, it
wouldn't take genius to do better. There are a lot of people out there working on boring stuff who are desperately in
need of better software, so however short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchet down the coolness of
the idea far enough to compensate.  
  
As well as preventing you from being intimidated, ignorance can sometimes help you discover new ideas. [Steve
Wozniak](http://foundersatwork.com/stevewozniak.html) put this very strongly:

> All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every
> single thing that we came out with that was really great, I'd never once done that thing in my life.

When you know nothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and if you're smart your reinventions may be better than
what preceded them. This is especially true in fields where the rules change. All our ideas about software were
developed in a time when processors were slow, and memories and disks were tiny. Who knows what obsolete assumptions are
embedded in the conventional wisdom? And the way these assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitly
deallocating them, but by something more akin to garbage collection. Someone ignorant but smart will come along and
reinvent everything, and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas.

### **Minus**

So much for the advantages of young founders. What about the disadvantages? I'm going to start with what goes wrong and
try to trace it back to the root causes.  
  
What goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that looks like class projects. It was only recently that
we figured this out ourselves. We noticed a lot of similarities between the startups that seemed to be falling behind,
but we couldn't figure out how to put it into words. Then finally we realized what it was: they were building class
projects.  
  
But what does that really mean? What's wrong with class projects? What's the difference between a class project and a
real startup? If we could answer that question it would be useful not just to would-be startup founders but to students
in general, because we'd be a long way toward explaining the mystery of the so-called real world.  
  
There seem to be two big things missing in class projects: (1) an iterative definition of a real problem and (2)
intensity.  
  
The first is probably unavoidable. Class projects will inevitably solve fake problems. For one thing, real problems are
rare and valuable. If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems, he'd face the same paradox as someone
trying to give an example of whatever "paradigm" might succeed the Standard Model of physics. There may well be
something that does, but if you could think of an example you'd be entitled to the Nobel Prize. Similarly, good new
problems are not to be had for the asking.  
  
In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real startups tend to discover the problem they're solving
by a process of evolution. Someone has an idea for something; they build it; and in doing so (and probably only by doing
so) they realize the problem they should be solving is another one. Even if the professor let you change your project
description on the fly, there isn't time enough to do that in a college class, or a market to supply evolutionary
pressures. So class projects are mostly about implementation, which is the least of your problems in a startup.  
  
It's not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as implementation. The very implementation is different.
Its main purpose is to refine the idea. Often the only value of most of the stuff you build in the first six months is
that it proves your initial idea was mistaken. And that's extremely valuable. If you're free of a misconception that
everyone else still shares, you're in a powerful position. But you're not thinking that way about a class project.
Proving your initial plan was mistaken would just get you a bad grade. Instead of building stuff to throw away, you tend
to want every line of code to go toward that final goal of showing you did a lot of work.  
  
That leads to our second difference: the way class projects are measured. Professors will tend to judge you by the
distance between the starting point and where you are now. If someone has achieved a lot, they should get a good grade.
But customers will judge you from the other direction: the distance remaining between where you are now and the features
they need. The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they need, and
you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the real world: there is no
reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole concept of a "good effort" is a fake idea adults invented to
encourage kids. It is not found in nature.  
  
Such lies seem to be helpful to kids. But unfortunately when you graduate they don't give you a list of all the lies
they told you during your education. You have to get them beaten out of you by contact with the real world. And this is
why so many jobs want work experience. I couldn't understand that when I was in college. I knew how to program. In fact,
I could tell I knew how to program better than most people doing it for a living. So what was this mysterious "work
experience" and why did I need it?  
  
Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical. Describing it as "work experience" implies it's like
experience operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programming language. But really what work experience
refers to is not some specific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over from childhood.  
  
One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake. When you're a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and
say "I can't" and they won't make you do it. Of course, no one can make you do anything in the grownup world either.
What they do instead is fire you. And when motivated by that you find you can do a lot more than you realized. So one of
the things employers expect from someone with "work experience" is the elimination of the flake reflex‚Äîthe ability to
get things done, with no excuses.  
  
The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding of what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically
horrible it is. Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spend most of your waking hours doing stuff
someone else wants, or starve. There are a few places where the work is so interesting that this is concealed, because
what other people want done happens to coincide with what you want to work on. But you only have to imagine what would
happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.  
  
It's not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain it. They never explain what the deal is with money.
You know from an early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone asks what you're going to "be" when you
grow up. What they don't tell you is that as a kid you're sitting on the shoulders of someone else who's treading water,
and that starting working means you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading water yourself or
sink. "Being" something is incidental; the immediate problem is not to drown.  
  
The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only gradually. At least it did for me. One's first thought
tends to be simply "This sucks. I'm in debt. Plus I have to get up on monday and go to work." Gradually you realize that
these two things are as tightly connected as only a market can make them.  
  
So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20 year old founders is that they know what they're
trying to avoid. To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates into buying Ferraris, or being admired. To
someone who has learned from experience about the relationship between money and work, it translates to something way
more important: it means you get to opt out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people. Getting
rich means you can stop treading water.  
  
Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup succeed‚Äîwith the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in
fact. But understanding the relationship between money and work also changes the way you work. You don't get money just
for working, but for doing things other people want. Someone who's figured that out will automatically focus more on the
user. And that cures the other half of the class-project syndrome. After you've been working for a while, you yourself
tend to measure what you've done the same way the market does.  
  
Of course, you don't have to spend years working to learn this stuff. If you're sufficiently perceptive you can grasp
these things while you're still in school. Sam Altman did. He must have, because Loopt is no class project. And as his
example suggests, this can be valuable knowledge. At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you already have most of what you
gain from the "work experience" employers consider so desirable. But of course if you really get it, you can use this
information in a way that's more valuable to you than that.

### **Now**

So suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, either when you graduate or a few years after. What should
you do now? For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare while you're in college. If you want to get a job
when you graduate, you should get summer jobs at places you'd like to work. If you want to go to grad school, it will
help to work on research projects as an undergrad. What's the equivalent for startups? How do you keep your options
maximally open?  
  
One thing you can do while you're still in school is to learn how startups work. Unfortunately that's not easy. Few if
any colleges have classes about startups. There may be business school classes on entrepreneurship, as they call it over
there, but these are likely to be a waste of time. Business schools like to talk about startups, but philosophically
they're at the opposite end of the spectrum. Most books on startups also seem to be useless. I've looked at a few and
none get it right. Books in most fields are written by people who know the subject from experience, but for startups
there's a unique problem: by definition the founders of successful startups don't need to write books to make money. As
a result most books on the subject end up being written by people who don't understand it.  
  
So I'd be skeptical of classes and books. The way to learn about startups is by watching them in action, preferably by
working at one. How do you do that as an undergrad? Probably by sneaking in through the back door. Just hang around a
lot and gradually start doing things for them. Most startups are (or should be) very cautious about hiring. Every hire
increases the burn rate, and bad hires early on are hard to recover from. However, startups usually have a fairly
informal atmosphere, and there's always a lot that needs to be done. If you just start doing stuff for them, many will
be too busy to shoo you away. You can thus gradually work your way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an
official job later, or not, whichever you prefer. This won't work for all startups, but it would work for most I've
known.  
  
Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the wealth of co-founders. Look at the people around you and
ask yourself which you'd like to work with. When you apply that test, you may find you get surprising results. You may
find you'd prefer the quiet guy you've mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive but has an attitude to match. I'm
not suggesting you suck up to people you don't really like because you think one day they'll be successful. Exactly the
opposite, in fact: you should only start a startup with someone you like, because a startup will put your friendship
through a stress test. I'm just saying you should think about who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of
whoever circumstances throw you together with.  
  
Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you in a startup. These may be different from the skills
you'd learn to get a job. For example, thinking about getting a job will make you want to learn programming languages
you think employers want, like Java and C++. Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pick the language, so you have
to think about which will actually let you get the most done. If you use that test you might end up learning Ruby or
Python instead.  
  
But the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming technique. It's a knack for understanding users
and figuring out how to give them what they want. I know I repeat this, but that's because it's so important. And it's a
skill you can learn, though perhaps habit might be a better word. Get into the habit of thinking of software as having
users. What do those users want? What would make them say wow?  
  
This is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the concept of users is missing from most college programming
classes. The way you get taught programming in college would be like teaching writing as grammar, without mentioning
that its purpose is to communicate something to an audience. Fortunately an audience for software is now only an http
request away. So in addition to the programming you do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people will
find useful? At the very least it will teach you how to write software with users. In the best case, it might not just
be preparation for a startup, but the startup itself, like it was for Yahoo and Google.

### **Notes**

\[1\] Even the desire to protect one's children seems weaker, judging from things people have historically done to their
kids rather than risk their community's disapproval. (I assume we still do things that will be regarded in the future as
barbaric, but historical abuses are easier for us to see.)  
  
\[2\] Worrying that Y Combinator makes founders move for 3 months also suggests one underestimates how hard it is to
start a startup. You're going to have to put up with much greater inconveniences than that.  
  
\[3\] Most employee agreements say that any idea relating to the company's present or potential future business belongs
to them. Often as not the second clause could include any possible startup, and anyone doing due diligence for an
investor or acquirer will assume the worst.  
  
To be safe either (a) don't use code written while you were still employed in your previous job, or (b) get your
employer to renounce, in writing, any claim to the code you write for your side project. Many will consent to (b) rather
than lose a prized employee. The downside is that you'll have to tell them exactly what your project does.  
  
\[4\] Geshke and Warnock only founded Adobe because Xerox ignored them. If Xerox had used what they built, they would
probably never have left PARC.

W16).

**Discussed:** Deciding to Start a Supersonic Airplane Company; Innovation in Aviation; Blake's Career Before Boom;
Deciding Whether or Not to Do YC; Being a Hard Tech Company in YC; Meeting with Richard Branson; Demo Day; Advice for
Other Hard Tech Companies.

-----

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Let's start with the most simple question. What does Boom do?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Boom is building supersonic passenger airplanes that lots of people can afford to
fly. Fifty years after the design of the Concorde, we finally have the technology to make high-speed travel economical
for airlines and affordable for passengers. We're gonna make the planet more accessible.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> And where did the idea come from?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Well, the idea of supersonic travel isn't new, obviously. I've been a pilot since I
was in college though I never got to fly on Concorde. It's really a unique story in technology that we've had a
capability and then we've actually gone backwards. Our phones are better, our computers are better, we're about to have
cars that drive themselves and genetically-engineered medicine, and yet we're still flying at 1960 speeds. We had a
supersonic airplane but we never took it mainstream. I'm unaware of any other story in technology that's like this.

If you look back at the history of entrepreneurship and innovation in aviation, all of the big breakthroughs have come
from founder-led companies. The first airplane was created by bicycle entrepreneurs, but also the first practical
airliner, the DC-3, and the first jetliner, the De Havilland Comet, were all created by companies that were run by their
founders. The last new commercial aircraft company was founded 1921. The last founder retired from the industry in 1958,
which, coincidentally or not, was also the year we had the first jetliner.

Since then the Boeings and Airbuses of the world have been... optimizing. They've been taking the same basic designs and
making them more efficient and safer, and in doing so they've completely swapped out the technology stack. They've made
the machinery more efficient, but they haven't improved human capability. I believe very strongly that if we want more
human capability, we need entrepreneurs, we need founders, and we need new companies.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Why do you believe the founders make the difference?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Founders have vision. Founders start things to make the world a better place.
Founders take risks. They make bold bets. By contrast, the CEO of Boeing thinks they overshot on the 787 and has
publicly said that their policy is "no more moonshots." And this is from the company that was literally in the moonshot
business\!

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Wow. So you were a pilot before YC but that wasn‚Äôt your job, right?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Yeah. I've loved airplanes since I was a kid, but it never really occurred to me to
be in aviation as a career. I went to school for computer science and had a first career doing ecommerce and mobile. If
you ask my closest friends, they'll tell you that I've been talking about maybe doing supersonics for 10 years. My first
startup was acquired by Groupon, and truth be told, there's nothing like working on Internet coupons to make you yearn
to work on something you really love, that you feel could make a difference in the world.

So after I left Groupon I started to make a list of all the startup ideas in descending order of how awesome it would be
if they worked and completely leaving aside everything else. And I figured, "Well, I'll cross things off the list and
I'll end up working on idea number five. It'll be, like, a rental car company or something." And, as luck had it, the
more I got into supersonics, the more I learned that it's not crazy, and actually the time is now.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> So what made you decide to apply to YC?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> At first I was really skeptical about YC. Isn‚Äôt YC for mobile social apps? How
could they help a supersonic airplane startup? But Sam put me in touch with other hard tech founders who had done YC.
They raved about the experience and how YC can help normalize and catalyze ideas that are off the beaten path. I
concluded that YC might not help with the airplane building piece of our business, but they‚Äôd help with a lot of other
pieces, like getting and demonstrating traction and raising capital. In the early days, capital was the biggest risk at
Boom‚Äîthere was a very real risk that we‚Äôd never get the money to build anything, and that the company would come and go
without ever really starting.

YC turned out to be one of the best things I've ever done. Boom would probably not be here today if it weren't for YC,
in so many ways. In YC, they basically gave us two big pieces of advice and it was exactly what we needed. Number
one‚Äìget your ass out of stealth mode, it's not helping you. And number two‚Äìgo sell some airplanes.

And I was like, "Okay, I don't know how 10 guys in a basement who say they're building supersonic jets are going to sell
anything to airlines, but I could try." And it turns out you can.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Your first deal was with Virgin, right?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Yeah, the advice that we got from our group partners during YC was, "Show up on
demo day with sales or your goose is pretty cooked." So I looked at my sales pipeline and it was like United, Delta,
Lufthansa, and Air China. At that point, we had like eight or nine weeks to demo day and I‚Äôm like, "There's no way I'm
closing Lufthansa by demo day. Just not going to happen. I'll be lucky if I close Lufthansa in nine years, let alone
nine weeks." So, I'm like, "Okay, well it's either gonna be a startup airline or it's gonna be Virgin."

So we decided to focus all of our sales efforts on startups and Virgin. There have been some startup airlines that have
done all business class. And so we went after all the guys who are either currently operating, are starting, or have
started in the past all-business-class airlines. And we got one of them to do an LOI.

Up to literally 24 hours before our slot on stage at demo day two, all we had was an LOI from a startup. If we had been
on demo day one, the history of the company would be different, but because we were on demo day two we got an email from
Virgin on the night of demo day one that said, "You can announce the following‚Ä¶ We'll take the first 10 airplanes, and
we've got options on them. And through Virgin Galactic, we're gonna help you build it."

I fell off my chair and almost screamed. I had to read the thing three times before I would tell the team because I
didn't believe it. And so, we went from what could have been the biggest laughingstock at demo day, to the team who
showed up with five billion in LOIs, a record that probably won‚Äôt be broken soon.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> That‚Äôs amazing. Do you have any tips for achieving that sale that quickly?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> The biggest sales advice we got during YC was, "Be persistent. Be more persistent
than you think you should be. Be so persistent that you're sure you're being annoying. And you'll feel like you must be
annoying, but when you have that feeling that means you're probably doing it right." And that worked.

The other thing that happened was, we went after Richard Branson directly. And we made sure we had two different avenues
to him so that one of them couldn't block us.

We had friends in Virgin Galactic that were supporting us and we had astronaut Mark Kelly, who hangs out with Richard,
on our advisory board. And Mark was, like, working Richard for us. What ended up happening was, in February, about six
weeks before demo day, Virgin Galactic was rolling out their new spaceship. We got an email in to Richard that said,
"Hey, the Boom guys are gonna be in Mojave for the spaceship rollout, you should meet with them while they're there."
And then we reached out to the Virgin Galactic guys and said, "Hey, we're gonna be in town to see Richard, can we come
to your rollout?"

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> \[Laugher\]

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> So we got the Richard meeting and we basically crashed the rollout. I had to fight
my way past the 18-year-olds that were, like, blocking and checking the invite list but we met with Richard. We had,
like, 15 minutes over breakfast with him and his mom. And we showed him what we were doing, and we said, "Look, we're
not asking for your money, we're asking, 'When this flies, do you want a Virgin logo on it?'" And I think that was key.
You gotta ask for the right thing. When you have a deal that's probably gonna be hard to close‚Äìask for what's really
gonna help you. We told Richard, "Look, if you're a customer we'll get the money elsewhere. We don't need the money from
you." And that was crucial.

The other thing that was crucial was having a deadline. For us that was demo day. And if you know anything about Virgin,
you know they really care about their brand, they really care about publicity, and we told them, "We are launching the
company on demo day, and either you can be part of it or not." And it would not have happened if we hadn't had that
believable deadline. And they had all heard of Y Combinator, and they took demo day actually a lot more seriously than I
thought they would, and they really wanted to be part of it.

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> If I had to boil all that down, I would say, be fricking persistent, have a
deadline, and if you're in a hurry, make the deal as sweet as you possibly can for the other side.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Great. And, just to jump back a little bit, I love that comment you made about
selling internet coupons making you want to start a startup. What advice would you give to someone at a job that's
pretty cush but they feel like they should go do something more interesting?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> I believe you have to find something in the world that you desperately want to
exist. Startups are hard - all startups are hard - and I think what makes the difference many times is are you working
on something that is so meaningful to you, that it is worth it for you to go through hell to make it happen? Because all
startups are going to go through hell. I'm unaware of a single one that hasn't, and the question is, "Is it worth it?"

Pick something that's going to be worth it, to you, personally. Stack the deck in your favor. Stack the deck such that
you will be motivated and when you look at what you can possibly create versus staying at Google or Facebook or Amazon,
it should pale in comparison.

If you haven't found that, don't start a startup just to start a startup. I did that my first time and it was a horrible
idea. Start a startup when you're like, "I must make this happen." And something that I've come to believe personally is
that the bigger the idea actually, the easier it can be because it motivates you. It motivates the people around you.
You can attract better people to come and work with you on it. The team we have around us at Boom is phenomenal, and we
wouldn't have it if we were building an app or a small airplane, even. We're able to get these people because everyone
looks at what we're building, and they're like, "I can tell my grandkids about this\! It‚Äôs either we're going to fail or
we're going to change the world. There's no in between."

I think there are a lot of ideas out there of that scale that people pass on it because they think it's too hard. Or
sometimes the most important problems are kind of hiding in plain sight, and we're so used to them we don't see them.
I'd love to see more founders just go for broke on that stuff. Maybe that's the wrong metaphor, but, you know, find big
ideas and go after big ideas.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Yeah. I think we could fund bigger bets‚Äìmaybe even slightly crazy people. Even if
one in a thousand of those companies worked out it‚Äôd have such a huge impact.

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> I mean, I wasn't dinging YC for that. YC's doing that better than, I think, anybody
else already. But I agree. It‚Äôs also not just about what gets funded, it's about who we inspire, and what we inspire
them to do.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Definitely. So I‚Äôm interested in talking about your experience at YC. Do you have
any advice for hardware companies in YC?

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> I think the thing that makes a hardware company a little bit different at YC is you
have to figure out what you can build that you're going to show at demo day. And for a software company, it's probably
relatively easy to figure out an MVP, for a hardware company you've got things that have a longer lead time. It might
not be possible to have your product done or in the market or even have a working demo. You should figure out really
early on something that both is and looks like actual, substantive progress towards the product.

When we were brainstorming on this, most of the ideas we came up with first were, like, "Well this is the most
meaningful technical progress, but no one's gonna be able to appreciate it because it's like, 'Oh, in our simulations we
get a lift-drag ratio that's hitting a critical threshold' right? And, that's actually super meaningful, but no one's
gonna understand it or believe it or get excited about it.‚Äù Then there was a bunch of stuff that was in the category of
kinda just for show. Like, we talked about building a flight simulator.

We ended up working on the aerodynamics and then we built a model of the airplane and made it look great. And we can
talk about, like, "Look at this. You can see these innovations in the model. That's why it works. That's why this is
possible." And, you know, that was concrete for people. We basically did the high-level design of the jet engine and
made a 3D printed model of it and then we actually physically brought to demo day the engine. One of the three engines
that will power the first airplane. And people, of course, were like, "OMG, jet engine."

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> Yeah, it's a nerd magnet.

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> Exactly. And we found and bought the one that we were gonna fly. So, it wasn't
bullshit. So, I think that's my biggest thing‚Äìfind the thing that you're gonna get done in three months that is progress
and looks like progress.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> That is an excellent point. Okay, last question. What are your favorite books,
movies, podcasts... any type of media, really.

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> I mean, far and away my favorite book is [Atlas
Shrugged](https://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145), and it's probably not an accident that all the
heroes in Atlas Shrugged are also pilots. Not an accident for me, personally, anyway.

Let's see, what else... I love things that give you insight into the basics of a field, even if you're not in it. I like
learning about biology on the side. There's a defunct podcast called [Futures in Biotech](http://futuresinbiotech.com/)
that, if you are not a biologist but you think biotech is cool, look up Futures in Biotech. Listen to all the old
episodes, they have amazing guests, and you'll feel like you know enough about biotech to kind of appreciate it. What
else? I'm trying to think of what's not a standard recommendation.

<span class='t-orange'>Craig:</span> It doesn't have to be non-standard.

<span class='t-orange'>Blake:</span> In that case, [The Hard Thing About Hard
Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205) is good. [The Innovator's
Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244), everyone talks about
it, I wonder how many people actually read it. You should actually read it. You should know what disruptive innovation
actually means.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html)

March 2009  
  
A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.  
  
Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one: hapless. Most dictionaries say hapless means
unlucky. But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a
bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be
battered by circumstances‚Äîto let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. \[1\]  
  
Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim for. "Don't be
hapless" is not much of rallying cry.  
  
It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running back. A good running
back is not merely determined, but flexible as well. They want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the
fly.  
  
Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most people outside the US. "Be like a running back" is
no better than "Don't be hapless."  
  
But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for
[investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html), and I had to explain what to look for in founders. What
would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That's
not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the
difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially how hard
they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful.
You have to keep trying new things.  
  
Be relentlessly resourceful.  
  
That sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think so. This isn't the
recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.
Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting
they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness. \[2\]  
  
There probably are other fields where "relentlessly resourceful" is the recipe for success. But though other fields may
share it, I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes a good startup founder. I doubt it could
be made more precise.  
  
Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other questions. For example, can this quality be taught? After
four years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly often it can. Not to everyone, but to many
people. \[3\] Some people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly
resourceful that only needs to be brought out.  
  
This is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority. Being
relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies, or in most schools. I don't even
want to think what the recipe is in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving some combination of
resourcefulness, obedience, and building alliances.  
  
Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about: how many startups
there could be. There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper bound on this number. There's no reason
to believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit
on the number of theorems that can be proven. So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the pool of
potential founders. Some people would make good founders, and others wouldn't. And now that we can say what makes a good
founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool.  
  
This test is also useful to individuals. If you want to know whether you're the right sort of person to start a startup,
ask yourself whether you're relentlessly resourceful. And if you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder,
ask if they are.  
  
You can even use it tactically. If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror. "Make
something people want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly resourceful" is how you get there.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Notes**  
  
\[1\] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted. No one writing a
dictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky. But a couple hundred years ago they might have.
People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad
outcomes have origins in words about luck.  
  
When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I
couldn't think of the Italian word for success. I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant. Finally she said
"Ah\! Fortuna\!"  
  
\[2\] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious. There can be times when what you're
doing is almost pure discovery. Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the whole. On the other hand, they
are in research too.  
  
\[3\] I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm
pathologically optimistic about people's ability to change.

### **Advice from 25 preeminent growth experts at top startups**

"Growth hacks," like Hotmail's [inclusion of a signup
link](https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/28/9-iconic-growth-hacks-tech-companies-used-pump-user-base/#.tnw_5FA2bL9V)
in its user's default email signature, can be extremely helpful in driving viral growth early in a product's path to
product market fit (PMF). However, sustaining long-term growth and reaching hundreds of millions of users requires a
scientific approach to growth. In fact, growth experts resoundingly say that "growth hacking" isn't in their vocabulary
or something they relate to their work. "Hacking" implies a haphazard / gut-driven approach, and the reality is quite
the opposite. Startups that have seen amazing growth have developed teams and processes that are intentional,
exceedingly metrics-driven, and thrive on experimentation.

To foster a scientific approach to growth, we've recently seen many companies break away from a strictly functional
organizational design (with product, engineering, marketing, etc.) to create a cross-functional growth team. Facebook
is, by all accounts, the pioneer of the growth team. Its first growth team was formed a decade ago with 3 people whose
impact was immediately evident. Facebook launched the growth team when it had \~50 million monthly active users (with
roughly flat month-on-month growth). The growth team and its surrounding program became a key driver of Facebook's rapid
expansion to 2 billion monthly active users today, as well as the evolution of the core Facebook product. Following
Facebook's lead, most successful consumer startups have created growth teams. Interestingly, these teams have converged
around many of the same best practices.

The Y Combinator Continuity team gets a lot of questions from founders on formalizing growth. Everyone is eager to
understand when to hire their first dedicated growth product manager (PM), how to structure a growth team, and how to
scale it over time.

So, we spent time with 25 growth experts, who have worked at companies (including Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Stitch Fix,
Square, Slack and Instagram -- [full list below](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#thanks-growth-experts)),
to identify best practices for establishing a growth program.

## **When to Invest in Growth**

A great way to waste money, resources, and jeopardize the future of your company is to invest in a growth program before
you've proven you can retain customers. In other words, it's best not to hire a full-fledged growth team (defined in
"[Building Your Growth Team](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#buildingteam)" section) to put major ad
dollars into growth until you've ensured you don't have a "leaky bucket" problem. If you you determine with the process
outlined in this section that you haven't yet nailed retention, you can apply a growth approach to *retention*. For
example, Stitch Fix hired a retention focused PM to run experiments to improve retention before they invested in new
customer acquisition<div id=checkretention> </div>

### **Check Your Retention**

### **Good** **Retention vs. Bad Retention**

The biggest question to ask at this point is: Is your retention good?

To determine if your retention is good, run through these 3 steps:

**1.** Stable long-term retention: Long-term retention should be stable and parallel to the x-axis (the y-axis
represents the retention metric). It is common to see a dip after the first period (e.g., month 2 for
high-velocity<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> products or year 2 for
low-velocity<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> products), but the most important thing is to make
sure that the long-term retention is stable and parallel to the x-axis (see this in the Cohort Analysis graph below).

**2.** Long-term retention in line with "average or median" benchmarks in your specific vertical: It is important to
benchmark your retention against companies in your specific vertical. For example, stable long-term retention of 10% is
poor if you are a social network.

**3.** Newer cohorts should perform better: "Cohort" refers to the group of new customers that started using your
service that particular month. Determine whether newer cohorts are performing progressively better than older cohorts.
If the retention of newer cohorts are better than older cohorts, it implies that you are improving your product and
value proposition.

Below is an example of how Airbnb has performed‚Äìwhich would qualify as *great* retention. The graph below demonstrates
stable long-term retention. Each new cohort did better than the previous one. For example, year 2 and year 3 retention
rates are better than the year 1 retention rate. Airbnb's long-term retention rate is better than the median retention
from competitors in the same vertical.

It is important to benchmark your retention against companies in your specific vertical. Below, we have included average
long-term retention targets for 5 business verticals.

Once you've passed these checks and know that you have good retention, you can take the first steps to build your formal
growth team, which we cover in the next section.

<div id="buildingteam">
</div>

## **Building Your Growth Team**

In the early days at a company, pretty much everyone is responsible for growth as they are solidifying product market
fit, and some companies treat this as a shared responsibility even past product market fit. The reason a company forms a
dedicated growth team is to pour gasoline into product market fit by launching structured experiments to drive a desired
behavior/action.If you have proven sustainable retention, you can focus on building a dedicated team to improve
retention even further while acquiring and activating and retaining incremental new users.

<div id="teammakeup">
</div>

Here's the most common makeup of an initial, Year 1 Growth Team:

*Year 1 Growth Team = 1 Growth-focused PM + 2-3 Growth Engineers + 1-2 Growth Data Scientists*

### **When to hire your initial growth team:**

1.  Most companies made their first hire when they had about 15 engineers on the team working on product.
2.  If you have strong retention, then the Growth PM (your first growth hire) is likely to be the 3rd or 4th PM on the
    team. The most common mistake CEOs make is waiting too long before they hire a growth-focused PM.

The trend is moving toward investing in building a growth team earlier on, with many starting to invest as soon as they
have strong product market fit and retention. Additionally, there is considerable evidence supporting the argument that
a formal growth team created at the right time accelerates the growth trajectory of a product.

A good growth team can also play the role of "defense" really well. Launch of new features and enhancements can often go
sideways and impact usage. The growth team has the ability to understand the root cause within minutes (not days) and
course correct the problem and thereby limit the negative impact. Facebook's growth team is considered one of the best
at defense and this has consistently helped them differentiate from competition since the early days.

Your first hires are critical as the initial team members will establish your company's experiment framework and growth
culture. 100% of growth experts refer to the first few hires as "magnets" for hiring and scaling the team. It's no
accident that many accomplished data scientists work at Stitch Fix as they are motivated to work and learn from the
leadership of [Eric Colson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ecolson/) (former VP of data science and engineering from
Netflix and one of the early hires Stitch Fix made).

While success cannot be attributed to the growth team alone, having a growth team in place early on helps accelerate the
overall growth trajectory of the company.

Typically, the first growth team hire is a Product Manager (PM). We found some strong trends in PMs, Engineers and Data
Scientist traits highlighted by growth experts who built successful growth teams:

<div id="PMcandidate">
</div>

### **The Ideal Growth PM Candidate**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GrowthPM.png" alt="GrowthPM" width="1505" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100039" />

1.  **Data-oriented:** The ideal candidate is intensely data-driven and inquisitive. All of the experts we spoke with
    said this is a must-have. You want someone in this role who will constantly ask "Why?" - even when growth numbers
    are up. One of the experts we spoke to said, "The scariest day is when numbers are down, the second scariest day is
    when numbers are up and you don't know why."
2.  **Prior growth experience:** It's important that the PM has experience at a company focused on driving growth in a
    competitive space (*e.g.,* e-commerce, dating apps, gaming apps, social networks). This means that you won't be
    recruiting out of a company like Google or Apple, as those teams didn't scale based on competitive growth
    strategies. More than 90% of the experts mentioned that prior growth experience is an important characteristic for
    the team lead to have.
3.  **Former startup founder** (bonus) **:** Interestingly, 60% of growth experts in our interviews were former
    founders. Why are they great PMs? Because people who've started companies tend to be able to think independently,
    are comfortable with taking risks, and have high levels of perseverance. This is important as many experiments will
    fail.
4.  **Existing PM** (bonus): If an *existing* PM has the above characteristics, then you might have the opportunity to
    appoint them as the Growth PM (as Facebook and Slack did). The growth team has to work with all stakeholders within
    the company and having someone who has already built up social capital within the company can accelerate the team's
    progress. This is great, but not a must have. 40% of the growth leads we spoke with were already PMs at the company
    prior to leading the growth team. Others, like Airbnb and Uber, hired a Growth PM especially for this function.

<div id="engineercandidate">
</div>

**The Ideal Growth Engineer Candidate**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GrowthEng.png" alt="GrowthEng" width="1488" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100038" />

1.  **Self-starter:** Since a big chunk of the work involves running experiments to determine what really works, the
    engineer should be proactive about coming up with their own hypotheses and experiments and iterating. Similar to the
    growth PM, they should have infinite curiosity and constantly ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù to uncover hidden insights.

2.  **Doesn‚Äôt cry over lost code:** This is someone who should be very comfortable with experimentation, knowing that a
    large amount of work won‚Äôt make it into the final product.

3.¬†**OK doing things that don‚Äôt scale:** Many of the tests will be small and without much impact-- so an engineer who is
fairly new - just 2-4 years of experience - might fit better with this mentality vs. someone one with many years of
experience that may train toward rigid requirements and roadmaps.

4.¬†**Great communicator:** Growth engineers should be particularly comfortable working with teams with several functions
- design, copywriting, data, etc.¬†

<div id="datascientist">
</div>

**The Ideal Data Scientist Candidate**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GrowthDataScientist.png" alt="GrowthDataScientist" width="1488" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100037" />

Lastly, a data scientist is a vital hire for a well-rounded growth team. Data scientists are in such demand that [Airbnb
announced](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/airbnb-is-running-its-own-internal-university-to-teach-data-science/)
recently that they have an internal university dedicated to training up data scientists.

1.  **Fluency with experimental design and interpretation:** Since growth is about running a lot of experiments -- more
    so than other data science roles -- it is important to test for this during the interview process. You can pose
    questions like, "Under a particular scenario, roughly how large of a sample size would you need?" and "How would you
    correct for multiple comparisons in this case?" You can also pull together a sample data set and run through the
    analysis live in a pair coding interview.
2.  **Coding Ability:** More so than other data science roles, growth requires more work to get & prepare data. This is
    simply because growth is often dealing with new data sets, and new data logging. Some suggested testing for this in
    an interview by doing live coding on cleaning up a data set together in Python or R.
3.  **Great Communication Skills:** The two most important elements of communication are (a) Communicating the results
    of experiments -- especially what can and what cannot be validly deduced from an experiment and (b) articulating the
    persuasive case for investing in certain growth initiatives. Someone with a strong business background and a strong
    familiarity with causal inference (econometric and experimental backgrounds are ideal).

</div>

## **To Do: Your Growth Team's First Year**

Once you have a team, there are five key initiatives you (and the team) will need to tackle in the first year. Here they
are with additional detail on each below.

1.  [Set absolute goal (with CEO) & Define key metrics](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#goal-and-metrics)
2.  [Identify growth channels](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#IDgrowth-channels)
3.  [Establish systems & tools](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#Est-systems-and-tools)
4.  [Establish user research](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#user-research)
5.  [Continue to iterate](https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-guide2017/#continue-to-iterate)

<div id="goal-and-metrics">
</div>

### **1. Set an absolute goal and define key metrics**

The most important thing is to identify your absolute goal and drive every aspect of the funnel toward improving your
goal. Casey Winters, former Growth Product Lead at Pinterest, wrote an excellent [
post](http://caseyaccidental.com/growth-goals) about this. What we mean by *absolute* is that goals cannot be percentage
changes or rate changes (for example, you should not have a goal like "improve conversion rates by 10%"). The goal needs
to be an *absolute* number. (For example, "achieve 5M first-time room nights this year"). Note that this is an absolute
milestone the entire team needs to hit.

An important next step is to break down an absolute goal into subgoals ‚Äì for example, if Airbnb's goal is 15M
incremental room nights per year, it would need to achieve sub-goals with an absolute number of bookings from both new
users and existing users. Jonathan Hsu, Partner at Social Capital (also part of Facebook's early growth team), has
shared his [growth accounting
equation](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc) -- here's
how Airbnb's equation would break down:

*\[x\] Room Nights = \[A\] Room nights from new users + \[B\] Room nights from existing users*

Similarly, Facebook's absolute goal of monthly active users (MAU) incorporates both new and existing users. Here's
Facebook's growth accounting equation:

*\[x\] Monthly Active Users = \[A\] New monthly active users + \[B\] Retained monthly active users + \[C\] Resurrected
monthly active users*

For marketplaces, the companies would have absolute goals (and sub-goals) for both the supply and demand sides, and
sometimes companies will have separate teams working on each side. For example, in the case of Airbnb the supply side
metrics would include Host Activation, Quality and retention.

At times, teams make the goal too unrealistic or set it in such a way that it is too easy to achieve. The most common
advice from growth experts is to set a goal that is halfway between "Sandbagging" and "Too hard to achieve". You want to
set something that is a stretch, but at the same time motivate the team such that it is realistic to achieve.

100% of the growth experts said that the CEO must be aligned when setting and defining the absolute goal. The goal also
needs to be communicated with the entire company so all teams are aware what the company plans to accomplish that year.
Often CEOs wait too long or don't fully endorse the goal and as a result, aligning teams within the company takes too
long. This could severely hinder the growth team's progress in the first year.

<div id="IDgrowth-channels">
</div>

### **2. Identify growth channels**

Once an absolute goal and subgoals have been defined, the next step is for the team to identify channels for their first
few experiments. The most common framework growth experts use to identify channels is based on existing user behavior.
The two key questions to ask are the following:

1.  How do customers find solutions / solve this issue today?
2.  How do your best users use your product today? Can you do something to get more such users to discover the product
    quickly?

The below behaviors were highlighted by [Linkedin's Aatif
Awan](https://www.slideshare.net/tractionconf/aatif-awan-head-of-growth-linkedin-growth-hacking-is-dead-long-live-growth?ref=https://www.linkedin.com/),
and we share some examples of companies that used those channels.

  </tbody>
</table>

Not every channel is relevant for all companies. Most products find 1-2 relevant channels early on that really work for
them. \~70% of experts mentioned that referrals were the top channel within the first year. Over time (as brand
awareness increased) other online advertising channels were more fruitful.

There are some exceptions to this rule were referrals do not work as well. For example - you can't offer a $20 discount
and expect team members to persuade other team members to join Slack.

<div id="Est-systems-and-tools">
</div>

### **3. Establish Systems & Tools**

The 4 most important elements you need to kick off a growth team are the following:

  - **Clean data set** to track key metrics and goals
  - **Segmentation tools** to be able to understand and segment the customer and activity at a granular level
  - **Rigorous experiment dashboard** to analyze the experiment results and the statistical significance behind them
  - **Peer review process** to discuss and analyze findings

It is critical for teams to have the right systems and tools in place to run experiments at scale. Especially key in the
first year is the experiment dashboard. Experiment dashboards are essentially a single destination to track
experiments/results, and allow for easy analysis by lots of people at the company. Dashboards contain:

  - Experiment group metrics
  - Control group metrics
  - A set of metrics defined to track and measure statistical significance

The dashboard helps the team to run various experiments and test the results before proposing every single idea to be
added to the product. As the growth team scales, the number of engineers increase and it becomes unwieldy without an
experiment dashboard. A company at scale typically runs **1 experiment per growth engineer per week**. With that future
state in mind, it's vital to start early with a solid growth experiment dashboard. The dashboard also becomes an
invaluable archive of past experiments that is also immensely helpful when adding new team members or iterating on past
experiments.

100% of the experts we spoke with emphasized their decision to build their *own internal tools* at scale. Initially, you
can use tools like [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/), [Superset
and](http://airbnb.io/projects/superset/) [Chartio](https://chartio.com) to track your experiments.

Here's a screenshot of Airbnb's internal experiment dashboard:

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Airbnb-Experiment-Dashboard.png" alt="Airbnb built its own dashboard to manage the growth team&#039;s experiments" width="2316" height="1208" class="size-full wp-image-1100043" />

It can take several iterations to formalize the experiment dashboard. For example - one of the experts cited that the
experiment dashboard was formalized after several iterations only after they had \~25 to 30 growth engineers on the
team.

**Peer review & Individual Experimentation**

Teams often set up an internal experiment review process on a biweekly basis. Team members present their hypothesis and
share the results of the experiment they ran to test the hypothesis. Peers ask a lot of questions to decide whether they
agree or disagree with the findings. Growth teams that run 100+ experiments per year cite that only a third of their
experiments turn out to be positive.

Though the success rate is only 20% to 30%, the point of this exercise is to encourage engineers to take more risks.

A common contention is whether engineers are allowed to run experiments independently. Companies in their early stages
often encourage engineers to run growth experiments on their own. However some of them require PM oversight as they
scale, especially as they get more rigid with quality standards.

Another important element is to make sure you set heuristics for the growth team. Growth teams are constantly testing
hypotheses and running experiments. One of the most common heuristic experts use is: *"Don't test things you wouldn't
ship to everybody"*

</div>

### **4. Establish User Research**

Data alone cannot answer all the questions. It is equally important to have user researchers in place to really
understand what is happening behind the numbers.

Your first 100M users will look a lot different from the second 100M users. Therefore it is important to do the
following:

  - Solicit real time feedback from users
  - Use tools like [Inspectlet](https://www.inspectlet.com/) to track UX
  - Meet users outside of San Francisco, especially if it was your first core market. Other markets will look a lot
    different from SF
  - Pay attention to how users use the product internationally. There may be cultural nuances in addition to language
    gaps (for example, people in Japan do not like to post photos of people without their permission and products may
    need to adapt to local taste).
  - Document every single use case. What is perfectly normal for one group can be very different for another group of
    users.
  - As you scale it is important to add dedicated user researchers to the growth team

### **5. Continue to Iterate**

While the above roadmap items will help set the foundation for a strong growth program, a lot of the tools, processes
and systems will evolve at scale.

## **Where Should the Growth Team Sit?**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GrowthTeamSitToday.png" alt="GrowthTeamSitToday" width="1130" height="1526" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100084" />

This has been the biggest source of debate among companies. Facebook pioneered the concept of a separate growth team
(meaning: Growth is essentially a department within the company). The rationale behind it was if they didn't assign sole
responsibility for growth of MAUs, then no one would own it. This has worked very well for Facebook, which recently
hit 2 billion MAUs (the only social network in the world to have achieved this). Facebook was also really good at
clarifying responsibilities across various teams. Advocates of separate growth teams cite that it is important for the
Head of Growth to report directly to the CEO.

However other companies like Uber, Airbnb and Slack, started with separate growth teams but later merged them with
product team. Growth is not about just looking at data to drive insight. The growth team also experiments and makes
subtle changes to the product to fuel growth, and this becomes increasingly important at scale. Therefore, advocates of
this approach cite that it is crucial that the product and growth teams are within the same org. In these cases the Head
of Growth reports to Head of Product.

Traditionally, a company's marketing team has been responsible for driving user acquisition (and the associated budget),
so this is sometimes a default department in which to house a growth team. Often this evolves from prior functions that
have lived in the marketing department (like performance marketing and user acquisition). In these cases, the Head of
Growth would report to the Head of Marketing. The general sentiment about this approach is that the line of reporting is
a bit rooted in the past, and most growth experts cited this as the least-favorable option.

The commonality, regardless of their department, is that the growth team can be more than 100 cross-functional people.
It is roughly composed of the following:

  - 10% Product Managers
  - 50% Engineers,
  - 10%-15% Data Scientists,
  - 10% Product Marketing,
  - 10%-15% Designers
  - \~5% Researchers

<div id="growth-in-DNA">
</div>

## **The End Goal: Growth is in the Company's DNA**

Hopefully, when you're ready to create a scalable growth program, this will be helpful. This is the newest frontier in
the cross-section of marketing and product, so it's still evolving. When done right, an amazing growth program will
permeate the entire organization, making an evidence-based mindset part of the company's DNA.

<h2>What is Venture Debt?</h2>

<p>Venture debt is a loan to companies that have raised money from venture capital investors (‚ÄúVCs‚Äù). Traditionally, banks only loan money to companies that have collateral (i.e. assets, cash flow, profits); venture debt is different in that venture debt lenders will offer debt financing to promising companies that are not cash flow positive, without existing collateral, provided that these emerging companies have raised money from VCs and show strong growth potential.</p>

<p>Money is essential for companies to grow, and venture debt can be helpful. It can boost a company‚Äôs cash reserves and extend its runway. It can provide a bridge so that a founder can delay raising an equity round, grow the company and attract higher valuations. Venture debt interest rates often are based off of WSJ Prime (currently at an all-time low percentage), and venture debt may protect a founder‚Äôs ownership by allowing a founder to retain a higher percentage ownership of his/her company. While venture debt can help a founder by protecting ownership, it also carries risks and founders should understand the pros and cons before accepting venture debt.</p>

<p>Venture debt investors are fundamentally different from equity investors. Equity investors understand that one successful investment can make up for a number of losses (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html</a>); venture debt investors expect to get repaid on every investment. With venture debt investors, repayment is contractually required: every cent must be repaid. Venture debt investors typically tie their investment to business plan milestones, metrics like accounts receivable and revenue, or events, whereas most equity investors allow startups leeway to pivot. Unlike equity investors, venture debt investors are less flexible. These investors are not as concerned with reputational damage: while an equity investor may support a startup that ‚Äúpivots‚Äù to find product market fit, a venture debt investor is less understanding, given the need to get repaid. Venture debt lenders are thus more apt to enforce a contract to make sure their money is returned, even if the company would be killed from such enforcement. These investors are myopically focused on losing as little money as possible; they rarely are interested in any other considerations.</p>

<h2>Strategy: How to Approach Venture Debt</h2>

<p>First, founders need to understand basic venture debt terminology. Founders do not need to be venture debt experts, but do need to understand their contractual obligations, particularly because venture debt lenders will rely on these contractual terms to protect their investment<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. Founders need to assess which terms are important, and which ones may place their company at risk. At the bottom of this essay is a short glossary and explanation of some key terms that founders will encounter in a venture debt financing.</p>

<p>Second, after understanding the basics, founders should consider evaluating multiple venture debt lenders in order to make the process competitive. Far too often, Y Combinator founders tell me that they met a venture debt lender, got a term sheet and quickly signed and agreed to terms. A founder would never speak to only one equity investor when raising a Series A round, but in my experience, it is common for founders to speak to only one venture debt investor. Fortunately, there are more lenders and new entrants offering venture debt, and founders now have additional options (more on this topic below). Working with a more friendly lender that you know well can make all the difference in a downside case, but you also should not drag on the venture debt raise process for months ‚Äì you have a business to run.</p>

<p>Third, founders must involve legal counsel when entering into a venture debt relationship. Again, the terms and conditions of venture debt financings arguably matter more than equity financings because lenders do not hesitate to assert their rights and will apply assertive tactics to recover every dollar they can. For example, there are important differences in the types of ‚Äúdefaults‚Äù that may trigger a loan to be due immediately, and experienced counsel will help protect a company and make sure that it is better positioned if things go awry. Often a startup involves counsel after a term sheet is signed, but it is better to involve counsel earlier in the process, which typically is when a company has more leverage.</p>

<p>Please note that while venture debt investors need to protect their investment, they also deserve to be treated fairly. There are many instances where venture lenders have complained that companies were not forthcoming about their circumstances and did not provide relevant information such as their cash burn, or the loss of a significant lost contract. It does not help a company to hide from its lenders ‚Äì the worst possible way to treat your lender is to make them think that everything is going according to plan, and then drop a bombshell on them when it‚Äôs too late to course-correct. Because there may be ways to restructure debt, it inures to a company‚Äôs benefit to treat its lenders fairly.</p>

<h2>Good news: New Entrant: Brex</h2>

<p>I mentioned there are new entrants in the venture debt space, and Y Combinator is glad that our portfolio company Brex is now offering venture debt financings to startup companies. Understanding startups‚Äô financial needs is in Brex‚Äôs DNA: the company grew quickly because it understood the challenges startups had with accessing basic credit. Brex knows how to serve startups and young companies with a variety of credit solutions and is a welcome addition to this market. YC has shared our concerns with Brex about the pitfalls of venture debt, and Brex has plans to make its venture debt financing terms simple and transparent. While we are confident in Brex‚Äôs ability to compete in any market, we continue to believe that all startups should reach out to multiple parties when accessing venture debt. To learn more about Brex‚Äôs offering, see [here](<a href="https://www.brex.com/product/venture-debt">https://www.brex.com/product/venture-debt/</a>).</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Venture debt clearly has many benefits -- it offers startups a less dilutive way to inject capital into a healthy, growing business, a business that most traditional banks ignore today. At its best, venture debt is an effective complement to equity financing, and helps accelerate a company‚Äôs growth. But accessing venture debt is not without risks<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>. Founders should be realistic and ask themselves whether they are taking on a burden that can be repaid. A company is best positioned to assume venture debt when it is confident in its ability to repay the loan, which will eliminate all associated risks.</p>

<h3>GLOSSARY: Basic Terminology (for familiarity only; counsel needs to be hired)</h3>

<p><u>Commitment</u>: What type of commitment is your venture debt investor making? How much money is being offered? When can your company access the money? Does the company need to ‚Äúdraw-down‚Äù over time? Can the company access all the capital at once?</p>

<p><u>Term Loan/ Revolver</u>: Term loans are for a set time period (i.e. 3 years) and have a fixed payment schedule. The payment schedule can be ‚Äúamortized‚Äù meaning that both the principal and interest is paid through periodic payments e.g. a mortgage; a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù payment means the interest payment is made throughout and the principal is paid at the end of the term (aka the ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù date).</p>

<p>Revolvers are like credit cards or a line of credit: a borrowing limit is set by the lender. Most venture lenders charge a ‚Äúcommitment fee‚Äù ‚Äì the fee can be a flat fee or a fixed percentage of the commitment and is intended to compensate the lender for keeping open access to the money. Make sure to understand how much money is being paid on fees: venture lenders tend to nickel and dime companies with tiny fees.</p>

<p><u>Interest Rate</u>: Interest rate is a crucial term and varies on a company‚Äôs ability to repay; the rate may vary from ~6-10%. Term sheets often express interest as ‚ÄúPrime rate plus x%‚Äù. Many lenders offer an interest only period prior to requiring repayment of principal.</p>

<p><u>Warrants</u>: Warrants are another critical term and provide the lender with potential upside as a stockholder in a venture backed company. Warrants are typically a percentage of the commitment (i.e. 5% of $2mm). Most lenders ask for preferred stock based on a company‚Äôs last round, but an increasing amount of recent term sheets request a set percentage of common stock. Obviously, it is important to speak to multiple lenders when negotiating interest rates and warrant coverage.</p>

<p><u>Prepayment Penalties</u>: Founders should make sure there are no charges for paying back their loan early (can be very useful if the market improves).</p>

<p><u>Investor Abandonment</u>: A clause that allows the lender to demand repayment if a company‚Äôs investor doesn‚Äôt invest in the company‚Äôs future round.</p>

<p><u>Negative Pledge on IP</u>: A clause that prevents a company from pledging its intellectual property to another party while the loan is outstanding. Sometimes lenders ask for a first-priority security interest on a company‚Äôs IP -- this is a term companies should not accept.</p>

<p><u>Field exams/ legal costs</u>: Beware of hidden fees! Look for clauses that allow the lender to conduct on site exams (at the company‚Äôs expense). Make sure to cap legal fees and do not pay the lender for documents that have been drafted a hundred times.</p>

<p><u>Current Ratio/ Quick Ratio</u>: These financial terms measure a company‚Äôs liquidity and may impact how large a commitment a lender makes. The ‚Äúcurrent ratio‚Äù measures a company‚Äôs assets by dividing the company‚Äôs assets by the amount of liabilities. The ‚Äúquick ratio‚Äù only includes the most liquid current assets that can be turned to cash quickly, and does not include inventory, supplies, etc. Venture debt lenders often use these ratios in covenants to monitor liquidity.</p>

<p><u>Default Provisions</u>: Defaulting on a loan allows the lender to ask for its money back and can kill a company. There are different types of defaults in venture loan contracts: technical default (violating a covenant); monetary default (missing a payment); change in status default (legal judgment); and there are subjective defaults: ‚Äúmaterial adverse change‚Äù or ‚Äúinvestor abandonment‚Äù. It is important to maintain a good relationship with your lender, especially if there is a subjective default provision that may be triggered. In these circumstances, a lender bank may choose to revise its debt, or make the more draconian decision to send the loan to its bank‚Äôs workout group.</p>

<b id="footnote1">1.</b> Venture debt terms and concepts are very simple; the language may seem daunting because it is
unfamiliar. The dynamic is similar to equity financings: it is disconcerting for founders when they first hear preferred
stock financing terminology (e.g. liquidation preference, broad-based weighted average anti-dilution, right of first
refusal and co-sale rights). But all YC founders quickly get up to speed and understand the meaning of these simple
concepts. Venture debt terminology may seem unfamiliar, but also can be understood quickly.
[‚Ü©](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/CH-venture-debt-101-basics-and-approach#footnoteid1)

<b id="footnote2">2.</b> I have not listed all the risks associated with venture debt. It is important to note that
unlike equity, venture debt requires a startup to agree to financial ‚Äúcovenants‚Äù -- e.g. a startup needs approval before
incurring additional indebtedness, selling assets, etc.. More important, in a downside scenario, a venture lender often
influences a company‚Äôs ultimate exit. That means if a company is running out of capital and has two options, one which
employees prefer and one which is better for the bank, the company probably will have to choose the option that is
better for the bank. These risks further highlight why founders need to be realistic about their ability to repay. To
emphasize, founders should remember that venture debt is a debt that needs to be paid back.

currently in a situation where you have 12 months or less of runway.

The hardest part of dealing with a low runway situation is managing your own psychology. You have to simultaneously
manage your own anxiety to not be overly negative about your prospects, but also not be irrationally positive. It's a
delicate balance.

The first step is to understand exactly how much cash and runway you have. **Before reading further, make sure you have
read both [The Fatal Pinch](http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html) and [Default Alive or Default
Dead](http://paulgraham.com/aord.html)**.

If you are Default Dead then it is your responsibility as a founder to immediately take actions to become Default Alive.
The mechanisms by which you can move from Default Dead to Default Alive are straightforward: Either you need to grow
revenue more quickly, cut costs, or both.

**Counter-productive ideas**

Founders can get caught in a thought cycle which causes inaction and an inability to fix the situation they are in.

Here are some common counter-productive ideas:

  - [The Fatal Pinch](http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html) does not apply to me
  - Investors will continue to fund my company if I run out of money
  - If I fail at fundraising I can just sell the company
  - My conversations with potential acquirers or investors are very far along and likely to happen
  - Acquirers won‚Äôt buy us if I cut costs
  - My employee morale will plummet if I cut costs
  - New investors won‚Äôt fund us if I cut costs

Don't let these ideas be the justification(s) for why you choose to remain Default Dead.

**Understand your leverage in a negotiation**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RunwayGraph.png" alt="runwaygraph" width="664" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1094809" />

What can we learn from the above graph?

  - Delaying taking action to reduce burn is a bad strategy. Make changes to become Default Alive **now**.
  - From a game theory perspective, an investor or acquirer is best served to stall and drag you along until you have no
    leverage at all. An opportunistic acquirer or investor is unlikely to say "no" outright, and will keep their options
    open as you become increasingly desperate.
  - If things looks bleak now and you take no corrective action, it is overwhelmingly likely the situation will get
    worse, not better.

**Some tips on reducing burn**

If you want to reduce burn, the least painful thing to do is make a lot more money immediately. Hopefully you have been
trying to do this anyway.

But what if immediately dramatically increasing revenue to become Default Alive is not possible? You must cut costs.

Real estate/lease costs are binding agreements and very difficult to get out of. Real estate obligations are a common
cause of death for later stage companies.

Payroll costs are the most likely source of high burn scenario. As mentioned in [The Fatal
Pinch](http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html), over-hiring is usually the root cause of high burn. If you do choose to reduce
staff it is imperative to treat your former employees well. You should also be transparent with your remaining
employees. Remember: You should always treat your staff as you would want to be treated.

The easiest things to cut are things like PR and marketing expenses, as well as random incidental spending on
perks/parties. Don't blow your money on this stuff.

**The point of no return**

So what happens if you have less than three months of cash? It's important to face the issue head on and account for
your liabilities and the scenario of shutting down your company.

In many cases, *\<2 months is the point of no return*. If you are in this state it is immediately necessary to lay off
your employees and give them severance, pay down your obligations, and use your remaining cash for shutdown costs. If
you don't do this and instead end up with zero cash and outstanding payroll, tax or other obligations, things will get
Very Bad.

Some things to consider at this stage:

  - When you hit the point of no return, you should shut down your company.

  - Do not become insolvent. Pay your debts. You must pay your tax and payroll obligations.

  - In especially messy scenarios you can end up with personal liability. Consult with your lawyers regarding how to do
    an orderly shutdown.

  - Don‚Äôt drag things out and end up in a no upside situation: no upside for you, for your employees, for your
    investors, or for your customers.

  - Even if things go poorly, behave in a way you would be proud of.
    
    It's tough to be a founder in a low runway situation. Get support and advice where you can get it. Mentors and
    advisors can help you navigate through these times. Often the toughest thing for a founder that has made it this far
    is to "admit defeat." If you are worried about your reputation, keep reminding yourself that it's just as important
    to handle situations well when things go poorly as it is when they are going great.
    
    In closing, if you remember nothing else, remember these two things: 1) don't lie to yourself and 2) act quickly and
    decisively.

December 2020

As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find that two separate essays I'd been planning to write
were actually the same.  
  
The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There has been so much nonsense written about this topic that
I've been meaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.  
  
The second is about something politicians sometimes say ‚Äî that the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting
people ‚Äî and why this is mistaken.  
  
Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously.  
  
I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict which people will become billionaires. I think I
can truthfully say that I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to becoming a billionaire ‚Äî the
defining feature of billionaires ‚Äî was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout, would surely
realize this and look for people who would be good at it, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.  
  
But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks for at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they
look for. I'll tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince Y¬†Combinator to fund you, and you can see
for yourself.  
  
What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make what they want. This is so
important that it's YC's motto: "Make something people want."  
  
A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on unwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power
to do that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will
never get off the ground.  
  
Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and for the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund
you. In a market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they don't already have. That's the great thing
about market economies. If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be,
and there would be no room for your startup.  
  
Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about something new: either a new need, or a new
way to satisfy one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the need existed and that you could satisfy
it, that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding.  
  
So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a real need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it.
That's what they are, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers. They have 1001 heuristics for doing
this, and I'm not going to tell you all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones, because these can't
be faked; the only way to "hack" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.  
  
he first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether what you're making will ever be something a lot
of people want. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now. The product and the market will both evolve,
and will influence each other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something with a huge market. That's what the
partners will be trying to figure out: is there a path to a huge market? \[1\]  
  
Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If [Boom](https://boomsupersonic.com/) manages to ship an airliner
at all, international airlines will have to buy it. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market is
by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that it's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of
these small but growable markets a "larval market."  
  
The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when they were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people
wanted their own computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every 10 year old on the planet wants a
computer (but calls it a "phone").  
  
The ideal combination is the group of founders who are ["living in the future"](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they themselves want.
Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage
online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building
things they and their peers wanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people
would want these things in the future.  
  
But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers, that's not the only kind. A larval market might also be
regional, for example. You build something to serve one location, and then expand to others.  
  
The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is
the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now, and want
it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of.
There don't have to be many, but there have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways
to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer you to their friends, and
so on. But these techniques all require some initial seed group of users.  
  
So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into during your interview. Who are your first users
going to be, and how do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question,
it would be "How do you know people want this?"  
  
The most convincing answer is "Because we and our friends want it." It's even better when this is followed by the news
that you've already built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your friends are using it, and it's spreading by
word of mouth. If you can say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from default no to default yes.
Meaning you're in unless there's some other disqualifying flaw.  
  
That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had made something they
themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit this gold standard of convincingness. If
Airbnb didn't hit it, it must be too high.  
  
In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that you have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And
the Airbnbs did have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated hosts and guests. They knew from
first-hand experience, because they'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer
to. We ourselves were not very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there
were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about as users. We were able to say to ourselves "They seem to
know what they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing yet, but maybe they can figure out how
to make it grow during YC." Which they did, about three weeks into the batch.  
  
The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about your users. So if you want to prepare for
your interview, one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're thinking.
Which is what you should be doing anyway.  
  
This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell them about the market.
Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're not ordinarily domain experts themselves,
so they forward the idea to someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time to do this, but if the YC
partners can convince themselves that the founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't lying, they
don't need outside domain experts. They can use the founders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own
idea.  
  
This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get funded, we made
interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to figure out, through the
indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask
you questions. There's not enough time for sequential access. They need random access. \[2\]  
  
The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview is that you should take control of the interview
and make sure to deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview into a pitch. ‚ü®elaborate
expletive‚ü©. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering it, they
deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast.  
  
There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do in a YC interview except a current or former YC
partner. People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of this, but interviews take all sorts
of different forms depending on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all about the founders,
other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away from
interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but they explained enough.  
  
Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them
candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to
bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you
are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter. And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell you that you
failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you don't,
and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them the answer to some related question.  
  
If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible answer is "nothing." Instead of convincing them
that your idea is bullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar. Far better to go into gruesome
detail. That's what experts do when you ask what could go wrong. The partners know that your idea is risky. That's what
a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome.  
  
Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you should
know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are.
Because the YC partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much.
They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat
they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be.  
  
The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At this stage, all they can expect are
promising hypotheses. But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying to make your idea seem perfect
causes you to come off as glib or clueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you didn't.  
  
If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is whether you'll be
able to find it. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their specific expertise
in this domain, and the relationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are they good at building things?
Are they resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?  
  
Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did spectacularly well in this department. The story of how
they'd funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast cereal was the single most important factor in our
decision to fund them. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them an irrelevant story was in fact
fabulously good evidence of their qualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined, and could work
together.  
  
It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole interview showed that they cared. They weren't doing
this just for the money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were working so hard on this company was because
it was their project. They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't let it go.  
  
Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all, not just in startups, but in most ambitious
undertakings: to be [genuinely interested](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html) in what you're building. This is what
really drives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires from starting companies. The company is their
project.  
  
One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them could have stopped sooner. They could have gotten
acquired, or found someone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who become really rich are the ones who
keep working. And what makes them keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the same thing that keeps
anyone else working when they could stop if they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.  
  
That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who become billionaires from starting companies. So
that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups are usually mixed. They're
usually doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the
problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's
ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like they're doing it *just* to
make money or *just* to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big scale. The founders who are doing it for the
money will take the first sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are doing it to seem cool will rapidly
discover that there are much less painful ways of seeming cool. \[3\]  
  
Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people. YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC
brand. But when the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad people made good founders, the YC
partners would face a moral dilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders. This exploitative
type of founder is not going to succeed on a large scale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one,
because they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC itself as a shortcut.  
  
Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which is disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is
the foundation of the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also disastrous, because the sort of early
adopters a successful startup wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this kind of founder can hope
for is to keep the edifice of deception tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it. But that kind
of acquisition is never very big. \[4\]  
  
If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is not the skill to look for, why do some politicians
think this is the defining quality of billionaires?  
  
I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person could have so much more money than another. It's
understandable where that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA of other species.  
  
If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad when one person had so much more money than other
people, who would disagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation
to use it for the common good. The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people are much richer than
others to the conclusion that there's no legitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're getting into
statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.  
  
There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things. But there are also plenty of people who behave
badly and don't make that much from it. There is no correlation ‚Äî in fact, probably an inverse correlation ‚Äî between how
badly you behave and how much money you make.  
  
The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends policy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people.
Can you imagine a better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids that the way to get rich is by
exploiting people, while the rich kids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how it's really done?  
  
I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your own kids the truth. It's all about users. The most
reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that [grows fast](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html), and the
way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll
never even get rolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies take their eye off it at their
peril. Stop delighting users, and eventually someone else will.  
  
Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I talk to founders
that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires now. What do users want? What new things could you build for them?
Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about that topic. That's how they became billionaires.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Notes**  
  
\[1\] The YC partners have so much practice doing this that they sometimes see paths that the founders themselves
haven't seen yet. The partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions often do to increase their
leverage. Although the founders feel their job is to convince the partners of the potential of their idea, these roles
are not infrequently reversed, and the founders leave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they
realized.  
  
\[2\] In practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your mind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially
convenient.  
  
\[3\] I myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer in my first startup, so I don't blame founders for
doing this. There's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You need to make money somehow, and for some
people startups are the most efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the startups that get really
big.  
  
\[4\] Not these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the Internet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs.

very often that aspirational product. My friend and former colleague [Connie
Chan](https://twitter.com/conniechan?lang=en) described WeChat as ‚Äú[the one app to rule them
all](http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/)‚Äù. It dominates the Chinese mobile market with 889 million
monthly active users<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. The WeChat platform has completely evolved
the way Chinese people communicate and socialize online, and it has also changed the way they pay each other and pay for
their groceries. WeChat is no longer just an app. And while WeChat‚Äôs blazing success has been concentrated in China,
*everyone* in the Western world has experienced WeChat‚Äôs work, as the service has inspired a new category of ‚Äúmessaging
as a platform.‚Äù You don‚Äôt have to look hard to see hints of WeChat in other messaging platforms such as Apple‚Äôs iMessage
or Facebook‚Äôs Messenger platform.

We partnered up with [China Tech Insights](https://www.chinatechinsights.com/), a research group within Tencent
(WeChat‚Äôs parent company) to understand how WeChat drives its **889 Million** monthly active users to use the app an
average of **50+ minutes, and 9 to 11 separate times, per day**<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>.
To put that in context, it is the same as the ‚Äúcombined time‚Äù users spend across a portfolio of Facebook apps, including
Instagram, Facebook and Facebook messenger, on a daily basis<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>.

This post dives into the growth strategy that led to key WeChat milestones, lessons learned and gives insight into the
method behind the madness as WeChat scaled from 0 to 800M+ MAUs in less than 6 years. Unlike AOL and Yahoo, Tencent is
one of the few companies to have evolved its messaging product portfolio successfully from a web/desktop product to a
mobile/messaging platform.

# Lesson 1: Build Your Own Competition

***Tencent Started WeChat (mobile-first messenger) as a side project, and it ended up reinventing messaging in China.***

Tencent was already one of China‚Äôs top internet companies in 2010, and the biggest social company even before WeChat was
launched. Many Chinese people grew up using Tencent‚Äôs QQ, a popular desktop messaging app (similar to ICQ and AOL
Instant Messenger). At the time, Tencent‚Äôs products had \~650M<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>
monthly active Instant Messenger accounts. Recognizing the growing importance of mobile, the company created a mobile
version of QQ in 2008, but the app was weighted down by desktop-centric features (e.g., multiple user statuses, large
file transfers, embedded services such as music streaming, etc.) back then.

Tencent made a bold decision: it put together a small skunkworks team from the QQ Mail team, its *core* product at the
time, to a new mobile app that could potentially *compete* with other product teams from other divisions within Tencent.
**This team of only seven engineers went on to create the first version of WeChat in just three months**. WeChat
launched in January of 2011 as a simple messaging and photo sharing app. This lean and relentlessly focused team very
quickly launched what would become the most transformational mobile service in China.

WeChat was not the first mobile messaging app when it launched. Xiaomi‚Äôs MiTalk was the leader at the time with 5M
registered users. Due to the intense competition, WeChat did not see much growth right after its initial launch. WeChat
realized they had to offer more than just chat to enable users to switch from other mobile chat solutions to WeChat. In
May 2011, 3 months after launch, WeChat turned on voice messaging, allowing people to send short audio notes (similar to
the native iPhone iMessage feature that came out 3.5 years later). The inspiration to add voice messaging came from
TalkBox and Kakao Talk. Using voice messaging was strategic because the native mobile keyboard to type Chinese
characters at the time was not easy to use and consumers found sending voice notes intuitive, personal and convenient
for daily life. As one of the first messengers to offer voice, text and photos in a combined solution, it enabled WeChat
daily downloads to spike to 50k-60k consistently.

Today Mobile QQ continues to cater to a younger user base and has 652M
MAUs<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> as of December 2016. Tencent proactively worked to
differentiate the user experience between the two platforms, with QQ offering more features for entertainment (e.g.,
animated video stickers, facial beautifying tools). Conversely, WeChat remains focused on offering useful services that
its users access in daily life (e.g., Content subscription and paying utility bills).

This lesson is reminiscent of Amazon‚Äôs move to cannibalize its own book sales with an e-reader / e-books (foreseeing the
trend toward digital content) and Uber‚Äôs move from town cars to UberX. If you don‚Äôt create a culture of disrupting
yourself, then a competitor is likely to disrupt you.

# Lesson 2: Design For Groups (‚ÄúGroup Effect‚Äù)

***An individual user‚Äôs behavior can be quite distinct from how they behave when in a group. To identify these
group-effect opportunities, WeChat closely observed how users behaved among groups of friends and strangers in everyday
life. WeChat did not lean on more traditional forms of user research, such as surveys, interviews or following
competition.***

Allen Zhang (Founder of WeChat) has been adamant about developing the product around ‚ÄúGroup Effect‚Äù (i.e., an individual
user‚Äôs behavior alone can be quite distinct from how they behave when in a group). So, the WeChat team pays attention to
how a feature may be adopted by a group of users vs. an individual user. This in turn also increases the rate of
adoption - as more users adopt these features, other users also hop on the bandwagon.

WeChat, like most social networks, realized early on that they needed to solve for the issue of having zero friends on
day one. Simultaneously, in the U.S., Facebook was famously relentless about getting users to their first 10 friends
within 14 days, which their data showed was the key to long-term retention. WeChat found success with a slightly
different approach to keep people engaged via a feature called ‚Äú**People Nearby**‚Äù, which was a simulation of the real
world. People could see other ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù users (who were not yet on their contact list) nearby through the
app<sup id="footnoteid6"><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>. The location-enabled feature satisfied users‚Äô curiosity about
knowing what‚Äôs going on around them and at the same time, boosted their sense of community on the platform. It also
helped boost the pace of user acquisition to over 100k+ per day<sup id="footnoteid7"><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup>.

After launching People Nearby, WeChat also rolled out account linking between WeChat and QQ, enabling users to import
their existing social graph on QQ to WeChat. Importantly, the team only exposed the importing feature to those who were
already using both products, so that users were able to use both services for their differentiated purposes. This move
rose the tide on messaging users overall, pushing the number of registered users on the platform up to 50M by
November 2011, allowing WeChat to overtake Xiaomi‚Äôs MiTalk as the leading messaging app in China.

**Shake** which utilized both the GPS and accelerometer had people shaking their phones to find a random person to chat
with. The feature served two purposes: a) give people a way to engage when they‚Äôre new to the product, and b) it had the
side benefit of creating a take-notice element to WeChat in the offline world, very much like people on Pokemon Go.
Launched in October of 2011, Shake was used over 100M times<sup id="footnoteid8"><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> in the
first month of launch. This feature was critical to scale initially, and used as a creative growth strategy, but it is
not popular today since most people in China are already connected to their friends and coworkers in WeChat. ‚Äú**Message
in a Bottle**‚Äù allowed users to exchange random messages by throwing a virtual bottle in the sea and when a user picked
it up, they were connected.

In November 2011, after launching all these important new features that facilitated group interactions, the new user
acquisition of WeChat hit a new record of 200k in a day<sup id="footnoteid9"><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>.

# Lesson 3: Extend Features from Users‚Äô Inner Desires

***WeChat paid attention to the motivation behind communication nuances and cultural behaviors to give users more than
they could ever think to ask for in a usability study. Allen Zhang was passionate about keying into the inner desires
behind an exhibited behavior, which often led to features that fit naturally into users‚Äô worlds.***

During WeChat‚Äôs second year, it launched **Moments** (the Chinese translation means ‚Äúfriend circles‚Äù), a photo-sharing
feature to visually share your story with a private group of friends. Unlike the Facebook News Feed, comments and likes
on a particular post can only be seen by ‚Äúmutual friends‚Äù and not by ‚Äúfriend of friends.‚Äù This was deliberate and
inspired by Path, a U.S.-based photo sharing and messaging app that launched in 2010 and limited a user‚Äôs social network
to a certain number of close friends and connections with strong ties. Instead of exactly replicating what Path did,
WeChat understood that the true motivation behind this use case and drew a parallel with an old Chinese philosophy
called ‚Äúcircle cultures,‚Äù meaning smaller circles are much stronger at the core and as the circles get bigger, the ties
get weaker.

A team of only 10 people spent 4 months making over 30 versions of WeChat Moments before deciding on a version to
launch. This showcases the efficiency with which the product iteration took place. WeChat always kept their product
development team lean since this brought a relentless focus on the features they were working on. Though there are a few
new features, the core product functions are not very different from the version originally launched.

Since the early days, many WeChat users shared content from external blogs and news sites via chat and Moments. The
WeChat team was eager to bring that content in house and let creators connect natively with their audience. Its solution
was **WeChat Official Accounts (OA)**. Released in 2012, OAs seamlessly allowed a ‚Äúone-way follow‚Äù similar to Twitter
(and competing with Weibo) for fans to effectively ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to content from their favorite celebrities. However,
unlike Twitter or Weibo, celebrities could send text, voice and video updates to their fans that looked like regular
WeChat messages and created a feeling of a personal and private conversation. This resulted in many celebrities setting
up their WeChat OAs even though they had millions of followers on Weibo.

The success of celebrity OAs prompted WeChat to expand the feature to accounts for brands and businesses. This has
allowed publishers to directly broadcast valuable content on a regular basis to their fans although the frequency is
limited. OAs also enable users to communicate with service providers (e.g., housekeeping) to do everything from booking
a service, to customer care, feedback and Q\&A. Where Twitter/Weibo were tools for businesses to broadcast and brand,
WeChat (via OAs) became a channel for direct communication with customers.

**Sticker Store** was a way for users to express themselves when communicating with each other (similar to what Apple
rolled out on iMessage many years later). However, WeChat was the first to create a marketplace for illustrators who can
earn tip money via ‚Äúrewards‚Äù from WeChat users who like their stickers. Users could choose to reward any amount up to
RMB 200 ($25 USD). The marketplace enabled healthy competition among illustrators to compete for the top spot (and
enriched the quality of the WeChat user experience along the way).

# Lesson 4: Big Ideas Come From Solving Your Own Problems

***Y Combinator has long advised founders to be an avid user of the product and solve their own problems. While WeChat
was sitting comfortably at the 300M MAU mark, a simple feature to help their own management team give out Red Packets
after Chinese New Year would help them nearly double.***

**WeChat Red Packets** originates from one of Tencent‚Äôs company custom and broader Cantonese tradition that every
manager in the company gives each employee a red envelope with a small cash gift on the first work day after the Chinese
New Year holiday. As the company expanded, it became exhausting for some managers to give out so many Red Packets so
they asked for technical solution to solve the issue ‚Äì they had no idea that the result would become the prototype of
WeChat Red Packet.

The first version of WeChat Red Packets was developed by a team of 20 in 3 weeks. It was tested internally on WeChat OA
users and was immediately well-received. Instead of releasing multiple versions of a product, WeChat team is an avid
user of its own products. Often they use the product in the middle of the night as a ‚Äúsingle user‚Äù to pay attention to
details and identify bugs early on. They also observe how friends and family use the product before it is released. From
New Year‚Äôs Eve in 2014 through 4pm on the day after, over 5M users used WeChat Red Packets.

WeChat Red Packets today has several different versions, including one with a random cash amount and one with a fixed
cash amount ‚Äì with the random packets, each recipient gets a random fraction of the total amount initially sent by the
sender (no more than RMB 200, USD 29 each to avoid bribery). This makes receiving a Red Packet in the presence of a
group of people like a lottery combined with a fortune cookie ‚Äì you have no idea how much money you will receive before
you open the packet, and getting more than others can be a sign of good luck. This good luck implication also makes it a
perfect game among close acquaintances at a party. This is another example of the ‚ÄúGroup Effect‚Äù in practice. Since Red
Packets are sent within group chats, the rate of adoption increased as more users received it.

The substantial growth was observed in 2015 with over 1B Red Packets sent during the Chinese New Year holiday. The
growth of WeChat Pay was initially driven by close tight knit social circles - friends and family sending money to each
other and they were willing to connect their bank accounts to do the same. This important move was necessary to build
trust among users and to inculcate the user behavior to drive mobile payments before extending this feature to more
shallow circles like paying merchants, online and offline stores. The payment network was boosted even further by a
partnership with Didi (China‚Äôs version of Uber) to facilitate in-app payment for WeChat customers‚Äô Didi rides. This
partnership opened up a broader universe of payment partners who now work with WeChat enable in-app payments for
everything from cell phone bills to utility fees.

In only two years, WeChat Pay has become the most significant player in the Chinese payments landscape, is used for a
multitude of actions - used for everything from Red Packets to offline payments. As of 2016, Tencent has 600M mobile
payment MAUs and over 600M average daily payment transactions.

# Lesson 5: Monetize Subtly

***Monetization and User Growth are not mutually exclusive. WeChat has always been ready for monetization and even uses
it as a lever to improve the overall product experience.***

**Game Center** bridged WeChat with the core expertise of the broader Tencent team to allow people to play games within
the messaging platform. While similar on the surface to other game stores like Line and Kakao, WeChat took the element
of social gaming to a new level - where people flooded to play games en masse. This subtle feature change benefitted
both game creators and WeChat. A Tencent game called Rhythm Master, for example, had 700k DAUs a year after release, but
exploded to 17M DAUs (\>20x growth) after launching it in Game Center.

Launched in January of 2015, **WeChat Moment‚Äôs native ads** were an important part of WeChat‚Äôs business model. While
this was not a key driver of growth, it did not limit the growth trajectory of WeChat either. To minimize the impact on
user experience, WeChat limited the number of native ads shown in a user‚Äôs WeChat Moments feed to one per day (compared
with Facebook‚Äôs limit of [one ad every \~10
posts](http://tumblr.jackdawresearch.com/post/152915251408/facebook-ad-load-and-revenue-growth) in News Feed).

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Moment-Ad.png" alt="WeChat-Moment-Ad" width="424" height="589" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099094" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Moment-Ad.png)
<center> An example of Airbnb‚Äôs native ad in WeChat Moments feed

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Moment-1024x433.jpg" alt="WeChat-Moment" width="780" height="330" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1099097" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Moment.jpg)
<center> If a user double clicks on the Airbnb ad they will see 3 or 4 photos with text sharing the story, which is very
similar to what WeChat moments offers with friends.

</center>

Users interact with and share ads similar to how they share posts from their friends, which is uncommon on other social
networks. For example, if you [tap on the ad](http://wximg.qq.com/wxp/home-site/case-video-preview/91.mp4), you can see
that the Airbnb ad is similar to a visual story and feels native in ‚ÄúMoments.‚Äù The ‚Äúlikes and comments‚Äù can only be seen
by mutual friends and not by ‚Äúfriends of friends.‚Äù Despite restricting both ad load and limiting the conversation to
only mutual friends, the above Airbnb ad, received more than 1.8M views after it was shared, saw a 5x increase in click
through rate, and drove a 600% increase in new sign-ups after it was shared by users.

WeChat even adapted the classic **coupon** model to a friend-based endorsement model for products and services. When a
user redeems a coupon offered by a vendor during an offline purchase, the user can opt-in to share the offer with their
friends resulting in all of the user‚Äôs friends being able to view and use the same offer. Vendors can also reward a user
who redeemed a coupon by giving the user another coupon for use and sharing, thereby extending the exposure of their
products and services. Thus WeChat established a coupon credit system for vendors to purchase credits from WeChat for
promoting their services through this coupon sharing model.

# Lesson 6: Measure What *You* Value, Not What You‚Äôre *Supposed* to

***WeChat defies the popular belief that growth is all about user growth. Instead they think about growth as increasing
value (e.g., the number of tasks WeChat can do in the daily lives of users).***

Unlike other social products, WeChat does not only measure growth by number of users or messages sent. Instead they also
focus on measuring how deeply is the product engaged in every aspect of daily life (e.g., the number of tasks WeChat can
help with in a day). While WeChat does have KPIs, these are typically shared only among department heads. The
drumbeat-message engineers receive every day is ‚Äúare you creating *more* value for the user?‚Äù In support of this goal to
be a tool through which people accomplish their daily tasks, WeChat puts limits on how many friends you have, how many
promotional messages you can see, how much engagement they display from your social circles -- ultimately they see this
as noise that may distract from the utility of WeChat.

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Engagement-1024x453.png" alt="WeChat-Engagement" width="780" height="345" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1099092" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WeChat-Engagement.png)

WeChat‚Äôs elevation of the QR code as a link from the offline became the lynchpin for China‚Äôs online-to-offline boom
in 2015. Previously, to engage with a service or brand, a user would have to search or enter a website address. WeChat‚Äôs
Pony Ma says of QR codes, ‚Äúit is a label of abundant online information attached to the offline world‚Äù. This logic
explains why WeChat chose to promote QR codes in the first place. QR codes never took off in the U.S. for three key
reasons: (1) the \#1 phone and the \#1 social app didn‚Äôt allow you to scan QR codes. (2) Because of this, people had to
download dedicated scanner apps, and then the QR code would take them to a mobile website, which is arguably more
cumbersome than simply typing in the URL or searching for the brand on social media. (3) Early use cases focused on
low-value, marketing related content and at times was merely spam. So, even though QR codes would‚Äôve been U.S.
marketers‚Äô dream, it was a few steps too far to be useful.

With the established adoption of QR codes, WeChat launched ‚Äú**Mini Programs**‚Äù as an extension of WeChat Official
Accounts designed to enable users to access services in a more frictionless way just like the web browser did (there was
no need to download a program to access a service in the PC era). Similarly Mini Programs is the tool that allows users
to open those ‚Äúapps‚Äù and take an action online (like placing an order or paying for merchandise) without requiring to
download or install the app. Think of a local restaurant or a local store in your city - they now don‚Äôt need to design
their own apps. Instead they can be part of WeChat Mini Programs. They are deliberately meant to be discovered via
social connections or the offline world by scanning a QR code. WeChat claims this user-friendly flow drives higher
purchasing conversion rates (though it is still early). Many of these use cases are low velocity use cases compared to
day-to-day messaging.

# Lesson 7: Don‚Äôt Play Favorites With Features

***One of WeChat‚Äôs core product tenets is it is a ‚Äútool‚Äù holding up utility-oriented qualities (highly functional, quick
and easy to use) as vital to the product experience.***

Most product managers are focused on building ‚Äústicky‚Äù features and driving retention metrics. However, Zhang actively
worries about users spending too much time in any one feature since this could prevent users from doing other valuable
things (such as paying bills‚Ä¶.which you can do on WeChat). In fact WeChat believes that a good product will encourage
user efficiency - i.e., enable users to complete the task quickly in the most efficient way and exit. Zhang compares
this to Google - once the user finds the right link, Google sends the user directly to the desired site. While it is
heartening to see users browsing the content on Moments, the team gets worried if they see too much time being spent on
marketing content on Moments at any point in time because low quality content can distract users and reduce value long
term. As a result, WeChat limits the amount of marketing content on Moments. Similarly, WeChat restricts the number of
broadcast messages that can be sent from Subscription Accounts by brands and businesses to one per day. In fact these
broadcast messages don‚Äôt even generate a push notification since it would impact the user experience.

Despite the deep and diverse set of features and services available in WeChat, the product team has maintained a very
simple UI. The app has only 4 tabs: chat, contacts, discover, and me. They‚Äôve been very disciplined in keeping the app
to only 4 tabs, as whenever they experiment with adding one, the left-most tab sees conversion rates drop by 20-30%.

To summarize, the WeChat team found ways to be scrappy, compete with their own products, built features that answered
cultural needs and emphasized group interactions and most of all they have relentlessly focused on creating a simple
tool that could extend into the hands of every mobile consumer. At this point, WeChat is not only an app -- it is simply
the internet. Which makes it easy to see why WeChat is becoming an inspiration to many hopeful startups.

become interested in the property and casualty insurance industry through a number of conversations with my
father-in-law, who is a commercial broker. While I'd thought a bit about health insurance before that, it was mostly in
the context of my own access to it, and the never-ending debate around Obamacare.

As I read Chubb's financials, industry reports, Warren Buffet's letters, and various blogs I came to realize that the
insurance industry was both far more complex and rife with opportunity than I'd assumed. While I've always been
attracted to fractured and regulated markets, nothing quite mimics insurance in its scope, nuance, and size. I wasn't
the only person thinking about this, as the number of recent insurance tech companies indicates.

## Problems

Here are a few core problems built into the structure of insurance
today.<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

**Data** Insurance is fundamentally a data problem. Insurance carriers set their rates based on actuarial models
designed to predict the likelihood of future events. Without access to oracular powers, these models rely on the best
available data when they are built and as they are updated.

This data is necessarily incomplete. It only becomes more incomplete as time goes on and more events pile up in a very
large and unordered world. For instance, a home insurer would be able to better predict the likelihood of fire if it
knew the details of every overloaded power strip in every home in its portfolio. It does not.

The issues faced by carriers with data extends to the setup of carrier/broker relationships. These relationships
necessarily involve lots of paper because there are few simple systems that easily integrate the two sides. This means
that information about customers is often relayed poorly, misunderstood, or simply ignored.

**Structures** Trying to figure out all of the different players in the industry is difficult at best.

When it comes to the distribution side, I can't do it any better than Kyle did here:
<https://medium.com/@kylenakatsuji/so-your-startup-wants-to-sell-insurance-a0167581f7b1>.

However, there are even more players involved behind the scenes which are important to understand if you want to uncover
opportunities:

*Reinsurer* - There are companies that purchase insurance risk from carriers. They are critical to the system because
insurers will often find that they are overexposed to a given risk (like that presented by hurricanes in the Gulf Coast)
and will need to offload some of that risk. Reinsurers traditionally purchase risk from carriers and from other
reinsurers. Reinsurers have also begun expanding the types of risk that they will purchase and the stage at which
they'll do it, sometimes acting nearly identically to carriers.

*ILS buyers* - ILS are Insurance Linked Securities. The most of famous of these are CAT (catastrophe) bonds. These are
created by insurers and reinsurers who wish to syndicate risk beyond the insurance world. This is done by creating a
bond which pays an interest rate and defaults in the case of particular event. The market for these is currently fairly
small, and the bonds are generally purchased by hedge funds. This market will likely expand over time as capital
continues to look for yield.

*Fronting carriers* - These are carriers that form partnerships with other entities, like MGAs (Managing General Agent,
defined in Kyle's post above), wherein the MGA writes risk using the regulatory framework of the fronting carrier, and
then immediately sells the risk to a third party. This structure allows entities that could not otherwise sell insurance
- whether through business choice, lack of regulatory capital, or lack of expertise necessary to form a carrier - do so
as long as the fronting carrier agrees.

Fronting carriers are not capitalized in the same way that large carriers are, as they don't hold risk on their own
books. They generally collect a fee - for the use of the regulatory framework - from the entity finding and pricing
risk.

The complexity of the structure of the Insurance market creates 3 other problems, below:

**Value chain** Each of the players in the structure needs to get paid. Premiums are the primary source of revenue
moving into the system, which means that every dollar paid in by customers has to be split between all of the value
providers. After paying for broker commissions, fronting costs, reinsurance, customer service, claims processing,
there's often around 50% of the original premium dollar left to pay claims - which is the primary purpose of an
insurance company.

Splitting a dollar in this many directions means that the individual players need to cut costs as much as possible,
which usually means worse service for customers.

**Fragmentation** Insurance carriers are fragmented at the highest level because of jurisdictional (state or country)
differences in regulations. This often requires different approaches in different markets. Insurance carriers usually
start in one geography with a few core lines and then expand coverage along both measures as they grow. Over time this
means that you have multiple companies offering similar products in similar areas.

The same thing happens to the ecosystem around each carrier such that there's no natural limit to the number of entities
operating in a given market.

**Confusion** The idea of insurance is complicated to begin with. The way it's operated at scale is even more
complicated, and only well understood by people who spend their lives doing it. Consumers generally purchase insurance
when they're forced to (home, auto, health) or guilted into doing so (life insurance). The only other time they interact
with their insurance is when filing a claim, which is usually at a time of huge stress and time pressure. At that point,
they usually deal with a customer service team that's been cut to a bare minimum because of the value chain problem.
This is a terrible dynamic that results in confusion, anger, and massive miscommunication.

**Incentives** The insurance industry is built on mitigating downside risk. Any new thing that they want to do comes
with a thicket of regulatory requirements and considerations. Combine this with the large size of existing players, and
you get a reinforced [innovator's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma). Notwithstanding the
fact that there are clear benefits to being the first to do certain things - Progressive dominated the first wave of
online acquisition and built a big company as a result - the downsides of a failed new thing are more immediately felt
and painful.

There's also a regulatory requirement in insurance that forces carriers to publicly file new policies. That allows
competitors to copy most of the mechanics and terms for a new
product.<sup id="footnoteid3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> While carriers don't have to file their exact pricing
mechanisms - which will often determine if a product succeeds or fails - knowing that anything successful will soon have
very similar competitors which will learn from your mistakes and then drive up acquisition costs creates a disincentive
to being the first to offer something.

**Differentiation** To the consumer, nearly every player at a given level of the structure looks the same because they
rarely offer unique features or functions. Most carriers are represented by multiple brokers, who generally represent
multiple carriers. This means that businesses have to fight one another on acquisition spend and brand building rather
than meaningful product differentiation. This leads to higher costs and lower margins.

**Speed** Insurance companies are slow. This is true of carriers and of brokers (on balance). Information still moves
back and forth across the system via paper and pdfs. There are multiple players involved in almost every transaction,
and the risk of getting something wrong typically outweighs the goodness that results from faster service.

Auto is a bit different because of a) the similarity of risk and b) the presence of vertically integrated players like
GEICO who have made speed a critical selling point and pulled the market with
them.<sup id="footnoteid4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>

## Opportunities

Given these problems, there are a lot of places to build startups. Here are a few thoughts I've had, and areas I'd like
to see startups attacking.

**Commercial P\&C (Property and Casualty) Carrier** This is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about. The way
that insurance for businesses is priced and sold is based on a paper world with little technology, or where technology
is ancillary to the core business of the company.

Increasingly, companies store information in programmatically accessible ways. This means that if you had clever ways to
ingest information about those businesses, you could price their risk more accurately, more frequently, and more
transparently.

A good place to start this business is with startups. They're small customers, but are not particularly well served by
the market. They also grow quickly, so capturing a large portion of them will lead to big customers over time.

**Commercial P\&C Broker/MGA** This is similar to the carrier idea, but without the regulations or regulatory capital
requirements which create a barrier to rapid scale. Brokers (or MGAs) can also produce more leverage from their own
technology use than carriers because their revenues are more sensitive to better operations than are a
carrier's.<sup id="footnoteid5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>

However, by moving away from being a carrier, this model loses control over the policies it would issue. I don't
actually think this is a big problem, at least at the start, since existing ISO policies are good enough as a
start.<sup id="footnoteid6"><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>

**Personal Cyber Insurance** Something I've only recently started thinking about. Most personal cyber insurance is built
around identity theft. While this is certainly a problem, it ignores the extent to which things like ransomware can
disrupt someone's life. Policies that cover these things are usually reserved for high net worth individuals, but that
seems short-sighted.

As more things in our lives become hackable, we'll need more help protecting ourselves from those things. Existing
companies that focus on homeowner's insurance are unlikely to understand these issues well enough to create great
products.

**Auto for autonomous vehicles** Judging from conversations, this is very much on the minds of the existing auto
insurance players. It's unclear who will hold the risk for autonomous driving, or how to structure the related insurance
policies. There are solutions to be built here both on the policy/product side, on the monitoring and claims side, and
probably within the distribution and sales channels.

**Insurance policies as code** It's strange to me that the core of insurance - the policies sold by carriers and
purchased by consumers - are virtually impossible to understand for most consumers. They're a mess of riders,
subclauses, and references to other documents. While policy owners generally know the headlines of any major policy
(generally the amount of coverage they're purchasing and the price), the specifics of coverage are opaque.

This seems like the root of the belief that insurance is an adversarial contest between insurer and insured, which plays
out in contentious claims processes and disgruntled customers. The carriers see the structure as necessary to cover
their own asses, and the customers feel compelled to purchase because they lack other options.

In reality, the policy is a system of nested if/then statements and is well suited to being expressed in code and
exposed to customers as a simulation. This would allow customers to explicitly model various scenarios to learn about
what they'd be covered for, and what would fall outside the bounds of coverage. It would also function as a transparent
tool for claims agents at carriers to show a customer why/why not a given event is covered.

Initially, this might just seem like a nice to have, but done properly this can either be the basis of a much simpler
way to sell (and upsell) insurance, or the core of an industry standard software suite designed to make insurance
companies competitive on customer experience. Implemented properly and at scale, it would even give carriers a way to
rapidly assess the risk of certain events, sell off risk that met certain criteria, and design products to fill the now
apparent holes in their offerings.

## Misconceptions

**Insurance people = dumb** The largest misconception I've seen in insurance startups is the assumption that people
working in the insurance industry are either bad at their jobs or dumb. I've written about this before as [a general
case](http://www.aaronkharris.com/presumption-of-stupitidy), but it seems to happen an awful lot in insurance. It's also
flat out wrong. If you spend time talking to actuaries or others within carriers, you'll find a group of smart people
trying to solve hard problems.

Also, there's Warren Buffett.<sup id="footnoteid7"><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup>

Founders I've met with this view have usually grafted the systemic issues of the insurance system onto individual actors
within it. While the result is the same, understanding the difference means that you can build businesses around
convincing players in the system to act differently so long as you can navigate the systemic issues.

**Carriers = the hard part** When I first started looking at insurance, I quickly gravitated to the idea of spinning up
a new carrier for a number of the problems I noticed. I did this for three reasons:

1.  Carriers have control over the largest number of pieces in the insurance space.
2.  Carriers can invest their float. I like investing, and I like the idea of having billions of dollars to put to work.
3.  Carriers are hard to set up because of the capital required and the complexity of the regulatory structures
    involved.

1 is right. 2 is accurate, but it turns out that investing float and earning a company level return off of it is much
harder than it initially appears given the size of float pools and the current low interest rate world. 3 was a very
important red herring.

It turns out that when you talk to experienced insurance people, they don't think of setting up a new carrier as
particularly difficult, just time/resource consuming. For most of the insurance world, the hardest and most important
thing to find is effective distribution and customer acquisition. By focusing on the carrier I was focusing on the
problem I thought existed within insurance, not the actual source of (initial) value that needed to be created. As I dug
deeper, I realized that much (though not all) of what needs to be done to make insurance better for consumers can be
done from a level or three removed from the carrier.

That's good news for startups, because insurance brokers and MGAs can generally move faster and operate at higher
margins than do carriers. They can also focus on one single thing: acquiring customers rather than spending an
inordinate amount time and energy on regulatory issues.

**Complex = impossible** Starting an insurance business is daunting. The complexity is a significant barrier, but it's
also a significant moat for the startups that manage to get over it. One thing that founders and investors need to
realize when investing in the space is that the time scale is likely different than that of companies in other spaces.

Startups that do manage to build the necessary expertise to create new insurance companies, combined with investors
patient enough to wait and support the time needed to do so, will create category-defining companies. The insurance
industry is too large and built on systems too old for any outcome other than massive change.

The best press advice I ever got was from Mike Arrington and M.G. Siegler while they were speaking at an SV Angel CEO
conference. They said:

¬†¬†¬†¬†**Treat PR like biz dev.**

Once I heard that, everything clicked. Before then I‚Äôd wasted mental energy thinking there were special rules for
talking to the press and getting great stories for my company. I needed cool and catchy subject lines for my emails. I
should have a list of a hundred reporters that I blast with new story ideas. I should write press releases. Needless to
say most of these efforts ended in failure. Sound familiar?

Treating PR like business development means developing relationships with reporters as people, getting introduced
through warm connections instead of cold emails, and creating a fair value exchange. Here‚Äôs the process I advise YC
companies to follow when they‚Äôre ready for press.

# Step One: Generate News

Many founders pitch reporters profiles and stories about their company that could be written today, next week, or next
month. Everyone wants a ‚Äúprofile piece‚Äù on their startup but most of the time those stories aren‚Äôt valuable to
reporters. What makes a valuable story is news.

**What is News?**  
News is timely. It makes more sense to talk about it today rather than tomorrow. News attracts attention now and that‚Äôs
what reporters want. News for most startups can be broken up into these 4 categories:

**1. Product Launches and Features**  
These are things coming out today. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, today. Think Instagram Stories or Facebook Timeline.
Typically you are looking for user facing features. In my last company, Socialcam, we would reach out to the press when
we released video filters, the ability to add soundtracks to videos, or user profiles.

**2. Product/Sales Milestones**  
This could be hitting [a million users](https://zapier.com/blog/one-million-users/), $100k MRR, or maybe [a million
guests per night](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/27/airbnb-hopes-to-have-almost-a-million-stays-a-night-by-summer/).
It‚Äôs important for this number to be as big as possible (relative to your size of startup) and I‚Äôd recommend you
sandbag this number - i.e. wait until you‚Äôre 25% past the milestone to announce - so that you‚Äôre that much closer to
announcing the next milestone.

**3. Significant BD Deals or Customers**  
Did you just get a team at Airbnb or Instacart to start using your product or service? Did you [partner with
GM](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055059/gm-partners-with-lyft-to-build-a-network-of-self-driving-cars) to build a
network of self-driving cars? If you have their permission you should consider announcing it.

**4. Fundraising**  
For better or worse, fundraising is conflated with traction/success so it is a topic people want to read about. If you
have raised an angel round or series A/B/etc. most reporters will consider this news and potential employees will notice
it, too.

**Note:** Many of the examples I‚Äôve used might seem a little aggressive for an early stage startup. My goal is not to
discourage you but to provide examples that will be generally understood. If you have any new product, milestone, deal,
or investment round you should strongly consider pitching it.

# Step Two: Make Your Own Press Contacts

Reporters want to talk to CEOs and co-founders--not PR people. As an early stage startup founder you should be building
reporter relationships and making pitches. Your success rate will go up and you will actually spend less time and money
on PR. Take it from me--we spent over $100,000 on PR agencies and PR people as an early stage startup before we figured
this out.

**How Do I Make Press Contacts?**  
Don‚Äôt spray and pray. It‚Äôs stupid.

The best method to meet a tech reporter is by having the CEO or a co-founder get a warm intro. If you‚Äôre a YC founder,
the YC founder network is super helpful for these. The reporter you want to meet has definitely written about someone
you know. Have them intro you. Proper etiquette is to ask your friend for an intro to only one reporter. If you aren‚Äôt a
YC founder, make friends with other startups and reach out to your startup community for warm intros.

Here‚Äôs what should be in your intro. The reporter should be able to read it and reply in thirty seconds.

  - News. Describe your news in one sentence.
  - For an [exclusive](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-press-exclusive-and-how-does-it-work): Let the reporter know
    you‚Äôre offering an exclusive.
  - For an [embargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_embargo): Say when you‚Äôre making the announcement. Include the
    date and time.
  - A request for a twenty minute call. Be courteous. You don‚Äôt need to meet in person.

When you get the reporter on the phone, be ready with three to five reasons why your news and your company is important.
Make them clear and then, at the end of your call, offer your notes and any relevant collateral (screenshots, graphs,
logos, pictures, etc). This will provide you with an opportunity to be courteous *and* provide reporters with the
language you prefer.

# Step Three: Pitch Those Contacts an Exclusive

Almost all startups should be offering their story as an exclusive to one tech reporter at a time. Your target audience
- investors, potential employees, motivated customers, early adopters - exist in high concentration in just a few tech
outlets. Getting blanket coverage across a bunch of tech blogs is often not worth the struggle and can piss people off
when embargoes are broken.

# Step Four: Share News at a Consistent Cadence

There is a philosophy in the PR world that the number of press mentions per story is an important metric. This causes
them to put all the best news in one story, infrequently, and try to get the most reporters to write about it at once.
For startups I actually think this isn‚Äôt the best strategy.

For me, the benefits of PR are hard to measure but they do exist. It‚Äôs like funding basic research in science, you can‚Äôt
predict the advances but they do happen when you invest consistently over time.

To see real startup PR results you‚Äôre better off getting one story every month or every other month versus one huge
story every year. To do that, don‚Äôt combine all of your news into one story, spread it out across multiple stories. Also
when you are looking at your stats or sitting in product meetings with your team, keep an eye out for potential news
that you can pitch. I tell YC startups to maintain a queue of 3-5 pieces of news that you will want to announce in the
coming 6 months. It takes the pressure off you if one of those pieces of news doesn‚Äôt get picked up, and it helps you
keep a regular cadence of positive news about your company in the press.

# Other Things to Keep in Mind

Just like BD, don‚Äôt expect to get every meeting and story. When a reporter says ‚Äúno‚Äù, ask yourself why. Were you
*really* giving them news and doing all the other things right? If you‚Äôre doing all those things well, you should have
a 25-50% success rate.

After six to twelve months of keeping up a good cadence and sharing real news, you should be relatively friendly with
two to five reporters. In other words, they‚Äôve written about your company enough that you‚Äôve probably met them in person
and certainly they‚Äôll reply to most of your emails.

Later on in your startup‚Äôs life there will hopefully become a point when press organically pays attention to your
company and wants to proactively write about what you are doing‚Äì‚ÄìDropbox and Airbnb are great examples. At this point,
oftentimes it is strategic to start creating distance between the CEO/Founders and the press. This is when PR people can
be very helpful. They create a buffer that allows you to be more strategic about what you announce, when, and to whom.

Lastly, remember that doing PR is a very small part of being a good CEO/Founder. Make sure you aren‚Äôt dedicating more
than 5% of your time to press and don‚Äôt expect PR to create observable miracles (tons of users, customers, investment
offers, etc). Most of the benefit I‚Äôve received from PR only became obvious weeks or months after a story was posted.

Some decision they made when they were younger is either blocking or creating a serious barrier to their success. These
are the decisions people commonly make that have the most negative effects on their ability to start a startup:

  - They didn‚Äôt learn how to write code.

  - They never met anyone who knew how to write code in college.

  - They significantly increased their expenses early in life, didn‚Äôt save, and now can‚Äôt afford to begin their company.

  - They created roots post-college in a city that is not startup friendly.

Here is the advice that they would have given their younger selves, if they could go back in time:

  - **Learn to code.** This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a Computer Science major. But college offers a great opportunity
    to learn the basics upon which you can build later in life. Being a programmer gives you the ability to work in any
    industry and start a company in any industry. You don‚Äôt have to be the best developer, and you don‚Äôt have to write
    code your entire life if you don‚Äôt want to -- but knowing how to code gives you the proverbial golden ticket to the
    *Willy Wonka* factory of the technology industry. The number one barrier to starting a tech startup is not knowing
    how to code.

  - **Meet people with real skills.** College gives students the opportunity to show their ability across a wide range
    of useful skills. There are designers, programmers, sales people, scientists, etc., all around you. Take the
    opportunity to make friends with people who have different skills than your own. It's very likely that these people
    could become your cofounders or early employees one day.

  - **Have fun.** Remember that for most successful founders, college grades and accolades had almost nothing to do with
    their future success. Personally, the greatest career opportunity college gave me was the chance to make friendships
    with really smart people. So get out of the dorm room or the library and be social.

  - **Take responsibility.** College is a great opportunity to learn more about how you operate within a group setting.
    Join the leadership group of a club where you are forced to execute on a real world task (organize a conference,
    create a publication, do volunteer work, play on a sports team, etc.) Learn what you are good and bad at when it
    comes to working with others.

  - **Be ready to hit the ground running.** In American culture today it's seen as acceptable to use your 20s to find
    yourself. I firmly disagree with this idea. Your 20s are your most valuable working years: You often have very few
    obligations (no family), a very low burn rate (you‚Äôre used to living in a dorm), and you are still young enough to
    meet new people and learn new skills. Use college to to get the partying out of your system and spend your 20s
    working hard.

  - **Be your own career counselor.** Career counseling at most universities is really really bad. Many students
    literally have no idea what they want to do when they graduate from college. Instead of putting all your raw effort
    into your coursework and grades, use some of your time at school to figure out what you want to do when you
    graduate. You can always change your mind, but having a plan is better than no plan.

  - **It's okay to ignore your parents.** Many folks choose to pursue a certain career because of parental pressure and
    poor career counseling. The number of doctors and lawyers I know who really don‚Äôt love their jobs or their lives is
    astounding. It's okay for you to make a career choice on your own -- even if your parents are paying for college.

  - **Be careful with student debt.** More and more, student debt is forcing people away from startups and into big
    companies. Once you make that decision, it is easy to spin up additional expenses (buying a car, renting a nice
    apartment, etc) and price yourself out of starting a company. Making a choice of a college is hard, but there are
    many expensive private schools that don‚Äôt offer good financial aid. They promise that the logo on your resume will
    be valuable -- but in the end, these schools are probably worth avoiding. The best private schools are generous with
    financial aid.

I wish my college dean had given this advice to me during freshman year, instead of whatever ‚Äúbright college years‚Äù
stuff I had to endure. Good luck out there, and remember that if you are between the ages of 22 and 32 you are in your
best startup years. Every year you are not doing a startup you are losing 10% of this prime time.

working 1:1 with founders to workshop their pitches and decks, I‚Äôve found myself giving the same feedback repeatedly.
I‚Äôve decided to compile that feedback into a single post and make it available to any founder looking to put together
a great Series A pitch and deck. Every single piece of feedback given here is something we‚Äôve told one of our founders
internally.

## What‚Äôs the purpose of a Series A pitch?

The purpose of a Series A pitch is to show investors why they should invest in your business. It should provide a clear
and concise overview of the business you‚Äôve built, and then paint a picture of where that business could go and why
raising money will help you get there.

Let‚Äôs break this down:

1.  **"Why they should invest"** - This is an investor pitch, not a customer pitch. Investors may not have encountered
    the problem you‚Äôre solving, and won‚Äôt intuitively understand how your product solves it. That‚Äôs why good pitches
    do 3 key things: they explain the problem your customers face and the impact it has on them, they show how your
    product solves this need and makes your customer‚Äôs life better, and they demonstrate why doing so is a good
    business.
2.  **‚ÄúClear and concise‚Äù** - Think of investor attention as a limited resource that you need to spend wisely. Making
    your pitch as simple and straightforward as possible minimizes the time required to understand your business.
    Investors should be able to glance at each slide and immediately understand the point that is being made. The best
    pitchers use plain English and avoid jargon as much as possible. Where jargon is necessary, they define each term
    clearly the first time they use it (and modulate this based on how much domain expertise their audience has.)
3.  **‚ÄúOverview‚Äù**: Your goal is not to download everything about your business, but to tantalize investors with enough
    information to keep them interested. Leave room for questions. A successful pitch lays the groundwork for a
    subsequent productive, in-depth conversation. Pitches should be 15-20 minutes, with the goal of setting the stage
    for the subsequent 40-45 minute discussion. On that note, if investors aren‚Äôt asking questions or engaging at all,
    that‚Äôs a red flag ‚Äî it likely means your slides are too complicated for them to understand enough to even be curious
    about what you‚Äôre saying.
4.  **‚ÄúOf the business you‚Äôve built‚Äù**: Start by talking about what you‚Äôve already built. Compared to your seed round,
    it‚Äôs harder to raise an A based purely on promise. Investors will want to know what you have to show for the time
    and money you already had.
5.  **‚ÄúPaint a picture of where it‚Äôs going‚Äù**: Getting investors to believe your vision starts by showing how your
    present reality is trending towards it. Once you‚Äôve established that you‚Äôve already built something impressive, then
    you have the credibility you need to show how it could grow into a massive company. Venture capitalists are looking
    for outsize returns, so they have to believe your company can get there.
6.  **‚ÄúWhy raising money will help you get there‚Äù**: The deck should make clear that the obstacle to your growth is
    actually money (not incompetence, poor product quality, a lack of product-market fit, etc.). The deck should end by
    making this explicit and showing how you plan to invest that money to get you to the next level.

## Starting Exercise

1.  Start by writing out your narrative as a list of bullet points. The more concise, the better - aim for 10-15 bullet
    points max. In YC, we call this your ‚Äúfundraising vertebrae‚Äù. YC founders should be familiar with this process from
    Demo Day preparations.
2.  Under each bullet point, list the data points you have as evidence that your argument is true. For example, if the
    point is that you acquire customers profitably, your subpoints would be numbers around what % of your acquisition is
    organic vs. paid, what your CAC/LTV or payback per customer is etc.
3.  Build your deck around this list. Each bullet point is one slide. The high level point is the slide‚Äôs title, and the
    data points comprise the content of the slide that help prove your point is true. If you‚Äôre trying to make more than
    one point per slide, your slide is too complicated. By extension, your deck should range from 10-15 slides, not
    including your appendix. See below for a more detailed explanation of how to structure each slide.
4.  Write out a list of questions investors could ask, especially metrics, and make sure you can answer every one of
    them in a clear and credible way. Have data to support where available. You need to demonstrate a solid grasp of
    your business to be taken seriously as a founder.

## Deck Outline

### **Title (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104519" />

Your title slide should list your company name or logo and a one sentence description of what you do. Anyone reading
your one-liner should immediately be able to picture what you do in their head. This means it should be:

  - **Concrete:** Example - ‚ÄúReinventing agriculture‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWe build and operate robot greenhouses‚Äù - ‚ÄúReinventing‚Äù is
    too abstract and ‚Äúagriculture‚Äù is so broad that I don‚Äôt get any new information about what you do.
  - **Use terms common enough for a layperson to understand:** Example -‚ÄúCreating behavior change among nicotine
    addicts‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúHelp people quit smoking‚Äù - ‚Äúbehavior change‚Äù may be a specific, meaningful term to psychology PhDs
    and healthcare executives, but that meaning will likely be lost on the average person.
  - **Specific to what YOU do:** Example - ‚ÄúPlant-based dairy‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWe make plant-based cheese‚Äù - in the first case,
    it‚Äôs unclear what you do around plant-based dairy. Do you produce or distribute it? What kind of dairy products?
    Your one-liner should make clear what your market is.

### **Traction (teaser, 1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-1.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104520" />

At every point during your pitch, investors are going to be evaluating whether you are worth their time. Putting this
slide early grabs the investor‚Äôs attention and convinces them that your presentation is worth listening closely to.

It also provides a smooth lead in from your one-liner (‚ÄúWe help people quit smoking. Our product is so good that in just
the past 2 years, we‚Äôve reached 500k WAU growing at 20% m/m.‚Äù) and transitions well into your problem (‚ÄúThe reason
people need this product is that smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer‚Ä¶‚Äù).

### **Problem (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-15.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104521" />

Outline the problem you‚Äôre solving. How does the world currently work for your customers, and what‚Äôs wrong with it?

**Make sure it‚Äôs a problem your specific product actually solves.** The problem slide is a setup for the solution slide,
which goes over how you solve this problem. The solution you present needs to seem like a natural fit for the problem
you‚Äôre solving.

  - Bad problem statement: ‚ÄúAmericans spend $400B on mental health problems.‚Äù There‚Äôs no way a tiny startup can solve
    this $400B mental health problem - each startup only focuses on a piece of it.
  - Good problem statement: ‚Äúx Americans need therapy but can‚Äôt pay for it‚Ä¶‚Äù This carves out a specific part of the
    problem you‚Äôre focused on - lack of access to therapy. This sets up your solution slide to focus on how you‚Äôre
    making therapy more affordable.

**Present the problem from your customer‚Äôs perspective.** Your customer is whoever is paying you for your product. This
distinction is especially important if the people that use your product are different from the people paying you for
your product. For example:

  - Healthcare - you‚Äôre usually paid by insurers even though your users are patients
  - Employee benefits - you‚Äôre usually paid by employers (specifically, HR departments) even though your users are
    employees

If you‚Äôre a marketplace, you have to pick one perspective to talk about the problem from. It typically makes sense to
talk about the side of the marketplace you‚Äôve prioritized solving for. For example, if you‚Äôre pitching Airbnb, is the
problem that landlords want to find short-term renters, or that it‚Äôs hard for short-term renters to find a place to
stay?

**Explain how the world currently works. Aim to show, not tell.** Some problems investors are familiar with; for others,
you need to show them that the problem actually exists. The best way to do this is to tell the story of what currently
happens in a concrete and specific way.

  - Bad problem statement: ‚ÄúMedical billing is broken.‚Äù This is vague. If I disagree with this statement, there are no
    data points or examples to show me why I‚Äôm wrong. Even if I agree with this statement, I may not believe medical
    billing is broken for the same reasons you do.
  - Good problem statement: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how medical billing works today: patients need to do X very inconvenient steps,
    which takes Y months of delay in reimbursement and results in only Z% of claims being approved‚Ä¶‚Äù

### **Solution (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-16.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104522" />

Now that you‚Äôve described how the world works, explain what you do and how it changes the way the world works. What do
you do to fix the problem you just outlined?

**Do a side by side comparison.** Your problem slide perfectly sets you up for this. It‚Äôs one of the clearest ways we‚Äôve
found to demonstrate exactly how you change your customer‚Äôs experience in a concrete way, and therefore, what value you
provide to her.

**Quantify your impact with numbers.** This goes back to showing, not telling. Don‚Äôt tell me you have the fastest /
easiest / cheapest product on the market, actually show me numbers around the speed, ease of price of your product vs.
the status quo.

Here‚Äôs an example of these 2 points in action:

  - Problem slide: ‚ÄúWhen businesses want to verify the identity of other businesses, they had to manually look up
    businesses in X databases. This process took Y days and Z% of these results were inaccurate.‚Äù
  - Solution slide: ‚ÄúWith us, all businesses have to do is submit a query to just one database - ours. This process
    takes A days and is B% accurate. This means they can verify C% more people D times faster.‚Äù

**Focus on what you do right now, not what you plan to do in the future.** Too often I‚Äôve listened to pitches where
founders paint a vision of an awesome-sounding product, only to be disappointed when I poke at it and realize they‚Äôve
only really built the very first piece. This comes across to investors like you‚Äôre compensating for not actually having
accomplished much - and investors will discount these hand-wavy hypotheticals to zero because you haven‚Äôt actually done
it.

**Don‚Äôt just tell me what your product can do, tell me how your customer actually uses it and why that‚Äôs valuable to
them.** In this vein, showing screenshots of the product or long lists of features is rarely helpful. Explain just
enough of what the product does to show how it solves your customer‚Äôs problem and changes their experience. For example:

  - ‚ÄúWe have a database of 100k entries‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúOur database allows customers to verify someone‚Äôs identity with X% accuracy

Your numbers should tell a story. The story should start with the most important metric to investors. If you have
revenue, this should be revenue. When you present revenue, make sure you explain how you earn that revenue - i.e. your
business model. This helps investors understand what drives your revenue, and therefore how your revenue might change
based on various factors.

The specifics of what numbers to report depend on your business, but ultimately the purpose of all of these numbers are
to convince the investor of an argument. (This is why our starting exercise above begins by deciding what arguments you
need to make in your pitch, and then collecting the data points that show those arguments are right.) Here‚Äôs a common
narrative in traction sections specifically tailored to enterprise and consumer companies:

  - We have revenue that‚Äôs growing really fast (revenue plus growth rate), based on a solid business model (key revenue
    drivers, margins and how those margins are tracking over time)
  - We‚Äôre great at acquiring customers (customer acquisition) and are able to do this profitably (unit economics)
      - For enterprise sales, key numbers could include: sales cycle, average contract value, salesperson efficiency,
        etc.
      - For consumer, key numbers could include: breakdown of organic vs. paid acquisition, CAC/LTV, distribution
        channels, conversion rates etc.
  - They love our product (engagement and retention)
      - For enterprise sales, key numbers could include: time to onboard, % adoption within organization, churn etc.
      - For consumer, key numbers could include: DAU/WAU/MAU, retention after one day/week/month, average amount of time
        spent on platform, average spend etc.

For hardtech and biotech companies, this section might focus on numbers showing the efficacy of the technology you‚Äôve
developed, how many patents you‚Äôve filed, how many partnerships or LOIs you‚Äôve signed and what the value and terms of
those commitments are, or a specific milestone you‚Äôve hit (for example, filing your 510(k) or IND application).

**Show trends.** What‚Äôs more important than where your traction is at this point in time is where it‚Äôs going. Your
current scale matters in that you need to hit a certain scale for investors to trust that growth: you might start off
growing 25% m/m off a base of $200k, but it‚Äôs sustaining that growth when you hit $1m that‚Äôs impressive. More important,
however, is how those numbers are changing over time. This is why a monthly or quarterly graph is better than a summed
up annual number. You also need to show at least 4-6 months of this trend for it to be believable (see our article on
[The Importance of Trends).](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/1z-the-importance-of-trends)

This is also why the amount of time it took you to accomplish these milestones is crucial context: it shows the speed at
which you move. That‚Äôs why we tell companies that the longer they‚Äôve been around, the more they have to have done. The
[benchmarks](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/1k-benchmarks) we compiled in our Series A guide are based on the
typical timeline of raising your Series A 18-24 months after your seed, but if you‚Äôve been around for longer, you‚Äôll
need to have to have more to show for it.

**Present numbers clearly and concisely.** Founders typically fall into 3 traps:

1.  *Throwing reams of numbers at investors:* information overload makes it hard to digest any information at all. Your
    job is to guide investors to the most important parts of your business. A good way to do this is to identify what
    your ‚Äúhero facts‚Äù are. These are headline numbers that prove a key point you want to make. They should stick in
    investor‚Äôs minds after the pitch, and be what they use when pitching you to their partners.
2.  *Too few numbers:* at the Series A, you need to have data to show you‚Äôve made good on the promises you made at the
    seed. At best, not being detailed enough with your data wastes precious time making the investor dig for it; at
    worst, it feels like you‚Äôre hiding your numbers because you think they‚Äôre weak.
3.  *Unclear numbers*: making your numbers hard to understand, usually due to either calculating or presenting them
    confusingly.
      - Calculating numbers confusingly diminishes your credibility. It suggests you either don‚Äôt understand how to
        calculate the number correctly (i.e. incompetence) or are not being forthright about what these numbers actually
        mean (i.e. dishonesty). A classic example of this is showing cumulative numbers. Almost every time I‚Äôve seen
        cumulative numbers in a Series A deck, it‚Äôs because founders are trying to hide their monthly/quarterly numbers
        because they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre strong enough.
      - Presenting them confusingly limits investor understanding of your business. At best, it takes awhile for the
        investor to grok what‚Äôs going on; at worst, they zone out and never actually get to understand what your numbers
        mean. A classic example of this is using double axis graphs - time is always wasted in clarifying which line
        goes with which axis, and then figuring out what those lines mean.
      - Here are a couple of good rules of thumb to avoid falling into these traps.
        1.  Graphs should be understandable at first glance. If it requires a deeper explanation to understand, it‚Äôs too
            complex.
        2.  Be very clear about exactly what your numbers are measuring. When you say users, are you talking about
            monthly actives or daily actives? When you say revenue, are you talking about gross or net?

### **Market (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-20.png" alt=""  class="center size-full wp-image-1104526" />

Show how big of an opportunity you‚Äôre tackling. We usually suggest a bottoms-up calculation. A general formula for this
is:

> *number of prospective customers x value of each customer to you*

A bottoms-up calculation should rely on real numbers gleaned from your current business - the number of prospective
customers is based on the customer segments you currently serve, and the value of each customer should be based on their
actual value to you right now. Top down numbers from reports are often not specific enough to the market your product
plays in, especially if you‚Äôre tackling a subset of the market, or if you‚Äôre creating an entirely new segment. If you‚Äôre
creating a category, it‚Äôs also useful to show a couple good analogies of massive companies that have done similar things
that you can pattern match against.

### **Competition (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-21.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104527" />

Show why you‚Äôre 10x better than everyone else trying to do what you‚Äôre trying to do. The key here is to convince the
investor that you have a high enough moat to make your business defensible against competitors.

### **Vision (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-22.png" alt=""  class="center size-full wp-image-1104528" />

Show how you become a $10B company. This is a thought exercise we used to make all of the companies in our Series A
program do to expand their ambition as much as possible. Here‚Äôs where you can dream and talk about all of the
hypotheticals you‚Äôve judiciously kept from the first part of your deck. You‚Äôve spent the past 10 or so slides building
your credibility by demonstrating the incredible business you‚Äôve already created. Now when you talk about the future,
investors are more likely to believe you.

### **Team (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-23.png" alt="" class="center size-full wp-image-1104529" />

If your team is one of your comparative advantages, then this should be your second or third slide. A team is a
comparative advantage if:

  - You have had a successful prior exit (e.g. started and sold a previous company for \>$100M).
  - You are one of the few people in the world uniquely equipped to start this company. This is typically true for
    biotech or hardtech companies where domain expertise is critical. (e.g. PhD in cellular immunology, former senior
    executive at Amgen, ex-professor of electrical engineering)

Otherwise, this slide has 2 goals:

1.  To show who the founders are and why they‚Äôre the right people to start and grow this company
2.  To show how great of a team you‚Äôve recruited, and demonstrate that you‚Äôre able to hire the skill sets you need to
    execute on your vision

As before, try to quantify the quality of your team by showing impressive logos, educational degrees, or years of
experience. If there are some particularly awesome accomplishments (e.g. I built out unicorn X‚Äôs growth team), call it
out. Remove anything else - yes, this means leaving off the headshots for every employee in your 12 person team.

If you‚Äôve been lean (e.g. accomplished everything with only a team of 4) or capital efficient (e.g spent $1m to get to
$1.2m ARR), this is a good place to highlight it. You can also optionally add a slide with your advisors (if they‚Äôre
impressive and especially if your company requires domain expertise) and existing investors. Just beware of signaling
risk - if you include a Series A fund on the list of existing investors, you‚Äôll be asked whether or not they‚Äôre leading
your round. If the answer is yes, then why are you giving the pitch? If the answer is no or that you‚Äôre not sure, that
could be a negative signal. In general, best to leave those logos off.

### **Use of Funds (1 slide)**

<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Series-A-Program-Deck-24.png" alt=""  class="center size-full wp-image-1104530" />

The ask is the climax of your whole deck. It‚Äôs what everything else has been building towards, so be sure to include it
(weirdly, I‚Äôve seen many decks without one). It should cover how much you are raising, what you will use it for (on a
high level), and where that will get you in 18-24 months (the typical time horizon for raising your next round) in terms
of your traction.

### **Appendix (as many slides as necessary)**

The appendix should include ammunition for the subsequent Q\&A/conversation that follows the pitch. If you‚Äôve done the
starting exercise outlined above, you should have a list of questions that investors might ask. Where having a visual
aid would help, create a slide to answer each of the questions on your list. Other good things to include in your
appendix are financial projections and a more detailed use of funds. This section will expand significantly once you
start pitching, as you develop more content to answer investor questions that arise.

### **A note on design**

Optimize for clarity and understanding, not beauty. Deck design should be focused on aiding comprehension over being
aesthetically pleasing. In our experience, this usually means keeping it as simple and bare-bones as possible. Avoid
anything that might distract from your main point. Two of the most common culprits here are fancy, complicated diagrams
that are hard to understand or colorful images that look nice but don‚Äôt help illustrate your point.

## Pitch Practice

Once you have your deck, it‚Äôs time to practice. Reach out to angels or other founders that have raised their Series A to
set up practice pitches. A good format is to schedule an hour with a 20 minute pitch, a 20 minute conversation, and 20
minutes of feedback. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôd suggest running it:

  - During the pitch section, time yourself. Is your pitch 20 minutes or less? Pay attention to how you felt during
    pitching - did you feel confident? Convinced of what you were saying?
  - During the conversation section, note what kind of conversation you‚Äôre having, and whether it was the kind of
    conversation you wanted to set up with your pitch. What are things you wanted your audience to ask about that they
    didn‚Äôt? What are pieces they asked about that you hadn‚Äôt thought about and need to better prepare for?
  - During the feedback section, ask your audience (these are questions we suggest YC founders ask during Demo Day pitch
    practice):
      - Were you confused? If so, when?
      - Were you bored? If so, when?
      - Did my deck help or hurt?
      - What are a couple hard questions I need great answers to?

Another good way to test individual slides is to flash the slide to a friend who‚Äôs never seen it before, and ask them to
tell you what point the slide is making. If it isn‚Äôt immediately understandable, you have some work to do.

## Presenting Over Video

Most initial pitches now happen over video (though some may progress to socially distanced hangouts, based on investors‚Äô
individual preferences). This changes the dynamics of your pitch. Here are some important things to do when pitching
over a video call:

  - Turn on your video.
  - Revamp your video and audio set up.
      - Make sure you‚Äôre looking into the camera, not to another screen set up on the side.
      - Make sure your face is well lit (one founder found the ring lights that TikTokers use to be a cheap and easy way
        to upgrade your lighting), at an attractive angle (please, not up your nostrils), and that you have a
        non-distracting background (use Zoom backgrounds if necessary).
  - Make sure your audio is working well, and that you have a quiet room to take the call in.
  - One person should pitch. This is almost always better, but it is especially true for pitches over video call.
    Switching speakers is usually confusing and hard to coordinate, especially if the two founders are in different
    places. However, it‚Äôs often useful for another founder to come to answer questions and take notes.
  - Record and watch yourself on video to see how you‚Äôre coming across. You‚Äôre going to have to overcompensate in energy
    and verve to make up for the fact that you‚Äôre a tiny box in a corner of the screen.
  - Have a rough outline of a script: we suggest writing out at least a bullet-pointed script (if you‚Äôve done the
    starting exercise, you already have an outline of one). This script helps make sure you hit all the important points
    in the right order. Plus, the benefit of pitching over a video call is that you can have it in front of you during
    the pitch without the investor knowing. If you know that you tend to be long-winded, writing out a word-for-word
    script can help you figure out how to convey your points concisely. However, avoid just reading off of it -- you
    want your pitch to come across as natural and conversational.
  - \[If needed\] Hire a pitch or speaking coach, especially if you know you‚Äôre not a great presenter.

## Refining Your Deck

We suggest setting aside 1-2 hours every day of your fundraise to go over how each meeting went and use that to improve
your deck and pitch. Here‚Äôs a set of questions to ask yourself after each pitch:

  - What did investors seem to get most excited or energized by? Usually, this is indicated by where they asked the most
    questions or were the most attentive. Would it help to emphasize this in future pitches?
  - What parts did they seem to zone out in? This could be because you weren‚Äôt explaining it well, or they didn‚Äôt buy
    what you were saying. Is there anything you could do to make this section clearer or more compelling?
  - What objections were raised, and did you have a well thought through, convincing answer to them? Look at your
    vertebrae - what pieces of it seemed to be the weakest or least compelling to the investor? Is there data you can
    pull, slides you can create, examples you can give, or people you can talk to that will help you better respond to
    these concerns?

[32m2024-02-05 20:11:35 +0100[0m - dagster - [34mINFO[0m - __ASSET_JOB - aa86ea93-ffee-453e-b9b0-7056271dbf6c - chunked_blog_docs - Y Combinator runs a [website](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching) where we help people find potential
co-founders.

While running that, we‚Äôve had a lot of people ask for a set of questions to help figure out whether they‚Äôre a good match
with a potential co-founder.

We‚Äôve compiled a list of the 10 questions that we think are the most important ones to answer. ¬†The best time to go
through these is after you‚Äôve gotten to know someone, have found an idea you‚Äôre both interested in working on, and are
deciding if you‚Äôre ready to commit to working together.

We‚Äôve split this document into two sections: the 10 most important questions to discuss before deciding to work
together, and other questions that will help you get to know each other. ¬†We also included a checklist of things to do
when bringing on a co-founder.

Note that no questionnaire can be a substitute for actually spending a lot of time together in person to determine if
you like working together and get along well in practice. That‚Äôs the only way to know if you‚Äôre actually compatible with
someone, and it usually takes several months to know for sure. This questionnaire is designed to supplement that, not
replace it. **Here's the [**Google Doc**](https://yc.link/10-questions-cf) version of this questionnaire if you'd like
to use it as a template.**

### 10 key questions to discuss before deciding to work together

We derived these 10 questions by talking to many teams who met on YC‚Äôs co-founder matching, and by looking at the most
common reasons founding teams break up. ¬†

For a lot of these, you may not know the answer yet or may not have a strong opinion. That‚Äôs fine\! Most things in
startups you figure out as you go.

The goal here is to detect situations where you might have strong differences, so you can discuss them early, rather
than being caught unawares later on.

The best way to go through this is for each founder to copy this document, write answers independently, then share your
answers and discuss.

1.  **Why do you want to do this startup? ¬†What are your personal goals here, both financial and non-financial?**
2.  \*\*What will our roles and titles be? How will we divide responsibilities? Who will be CEO?\*\*  
    Roles inevitably change a lot over time, but you should have a plan for what you‚Äôll each work on for the first 6-12
    months, and decide on who will be the CEO (and what the CEO‚Äôs responsibilities are).
3.  \*\*How will we split up equity?\*\*  
    It‚Äôs important to resolve this one early. This [section](https://yc.link/10-questions-cf-equity) of the co-founder
    matching manual may help.
4.  **Where will the company be based? Where will we each live? Will we work together in-person or remotely?**
5.  **What idea will we work on? If that idea doesn‚Äôt work out, are you willing to change the idea? Are you only
    interested in working on ideas in certain areas?**
6.  \*\*What needs to happen for each of us to go full-time (quit other jobs or school commitments)?\*\*  
    I.e., We‚Äôd have to raise at least $xx from investors, we‚Äôd need to validate the idea with a paying customer, we‚Äôll
    do it if we‚Äôre enjoying working together in two months. Obviously, this is N/A if you are both full-time already.
7.  **What is your personal financial situation? Are you willing to work for free and live on your savings? For how
    long? If you'll need a salary to work on this full-time (either now or at some point), how much do you need to feel
    comfortable? ¬†Will either of us put money into the company?**
8.  **What will our typical working schedule be (what days we work, what hours / day, etc)? ¬†How long do we want to keep
    that up? ¬†Are there any things outside of work that are important to you to make time for?**
9.  \*\*If we are successful enough to get to build a team of employees, are there things that are important to you
    about how we do that? ¬†I.e., building an in-person vs remote company, having certain cultural values, having a
    particular approach to hiring or managing people?\*\*  
    It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt have strong opinions on this yet.
10. **What will we do if we‚Äôre having trouble agreeing on an important decision? ¬†What will happen if we decide we don‚Äôt
    want to work together anymore?**

-----

### Questions to get to know each other better

These are questions that are designed to teach you things about each other that are important for having a good
relationship. ¬†These are good ones to go through once you‚Äôve decided that working together makes sense.

  - **How would your friends or colleagues describe your strengths and weaknesses?**
  - **What are you proud of having accomplished (can be work-related or not)?**
  - **What do you do with your free time? ¬†What are your hobbies and interests?**   
    One of the surprising things about successful co-founders is how consistently they have overlapping outside-of-work
    interests.
  - **What are companies, founders, or products you really admire - especially ones that you want to model this company
    after?**
  - **What were your experiences like at your past jobs or past startups? What did you like and not like about how the
    companies were run? What lessons did you take away?**
  - **What is your life story and how have your experiences shaped your values?**
  - **Have you worked with a co-founder previously? ¬†What was that experience like?**
  - **What kind of work is so fun for you it doesn‚Äôt feel like work? What kind of work do you avoid doing?**
  - **What are your long-term goals in life? ¬†What is your overall life plan and how does this startup fit into it?**
  - **What makes you most excited about working with me?**
  - **What makes you concerned about working with me?**
  - **What environment do you work best in? ¬†What can we do to help you create it?**
  - **What‚Äôs the best way for me to give you feedback?**
  - **When you feel stressed, do you tend to want to talk about what‚Äôs going on or avoid talking about it?**   
    Psychologist and founder coach [Amy
    Buechler](founder_link?slug=Hj-10-questions-to-discuss-with-a-potential-co-founder) wrote an [excellent
    article](https://www.notion.so/Anxious-3-Avoidant-Know-your-Attachment-Style-31964247e3274807a32b44caea38db19) on
    this and how these two styles affect co-founder relationships.
  - \*\*Are there pressures in your life that you‚Äôre dealing with now?\*\*  
    Often pressures or challenges in your life create pressure on your startup. ¬†If you‚Äôre dealing with a family issue,
    a visa / immigration issue, a health issue, etc., you should really tell your co-founder because it‚Äôs important for
    them to know what‚Äôs going on.

# Checklist of things to do when bringing on a co-founder

Ok, you‚Äôve gone through the questionnaire and everything seems promising. Great\! ¬†Here are some related things you‚Äôll
want to do.

### Before deciding to work together:

**‚òê [**Meet in person**](founder_link?slug=Hj-10-questions-to-discuss-with-a-potential-co-founder) and [**do a trial
project**](founder_link?slug=Hj-10-questions-to-discuss-with-a-potential-co-founder).**

**‚òê Do reference calls on each other. Ask people who have worked with your potential co-founder what it was like working
with them, and for advice on how to work with them effectively. It‚Äôs best if you do this transparently ‚Äì agree on when
you are ready to take this step and then swap suggested references.**

**‚òê Given how important this person is going to be in your life, if you have a spouse or a serious relationship, you
should have your significant other meet your co-founder.**

### After deciding to work together:

\*\*‚òê Create a system to prioritize tasks and decide what to work on.\*\*  
This is a great post on [one such
system](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4e-product-development-cycle-fundamentals). You don‚Äôt have to adopt this
one, but it‚Äôs important to have *some* system.

\*\*‚òê Set up a recurring 1-1 with each other (typically once a week) to talk specifically about how things are going
with working together.\*\*  
This concept was created by Amy Buechler, who named them ‚ÄúFounder syncs‚Äù. She wrote a [detailed
guide](https://www.notion.so/The-Founder-Sync-54f855a12de749fa9e74e928ca7fa5a5) to how to run them. ¬†Done correctly,
these can really help avoid co-founder breakups.

Would Doordash have become a billion-dollar company if Andy, Stanley, and Tony had never met? Would we all have heard of
Airbnb if its founders had never met? We‚Äôll never know, but it‚Äôs safe to say that a missed connection might have led to
a dramatically different outcome.

To avoid missed connections when using YC‚Äôs [co-founder matching
platform](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching), it‚Äôs critically important to represent yourself as best as
possible in your co-founder matching profile. You should treat your profile as an elevator pitch of yourself; it‚Äôs all a
potential co-founder will see before deciding whether to connect or to move on.

Here are some ways you can make sure your co-founder matching profile is as compelling as possible.

### **Preview your profile.**

View your profile as candidates will see it, and make sure you're happy with the way it looks. You can preview your
profile [here](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching/my-profile).

### **Record a video.**

If you have an idea you're working on, this is a great opportunity to give potential co-founders a clear and concise
pitch. *Check out* [*this video*](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6q-how-to-pitch-your-startup) *for help ironing
out your pitch.*

If you're not working on a specific idea, use your video to introduce yourself and describe what you're looking for in a
co-founder and a company.

### **Be concise.**

You should be honest, direct, and brief. Founders will want to see that you can communicate key information about
yourself clearly and concisely, as with any pitch.

### **Be thorough.**

Don't assume candidates will click on your LinkedIn URL; lots of users will move on if they don't see compelling
information up front on your profile. Make sure your education and experience sections contain all the items you'd want
a potential co-founder to know about.

### **Put some thought into your impressive thing.**

This question is an opportunity to give potential co-founders some insight into what makes you unique and how you think,
through a specific accomplishment or anecdote that you feel represents your abilities and values.

Avoid answers like "I haven't done anything impressive" or "this startup". Everyone has done things they've been proud
of, and while starting a company certainly is impressive, these answers don't give candidates any insight into the way
you think, the things you care about, or what makes you unique.

### **If you have an idea, pitch it.**

As a startup founder, you live and breathe your idea. You understand it more deeply than anybody else. This is usually a
good thing, but it can lead to some blind spots. One of the most common mistakes we see is vague company descriptions
with unclear value propositions.

Founders looking to join an existing company usually care deeply about what that company does, so you should be sure to
make your pitch clear and compelling.

Watch [this video](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6q-how-to-pitch-your-startup), and nail down your pitch in both
written and verbal form. Try showing your pitch to a friend or family member who hasn‚Äôt seen it before. See if they can
explain your idea back to you, and also if they can explain why it‚Äôs compelling.

### **If you‚Äôre non-technical with an idea, show the progress you‚Äôve made without a technical founder.**

If you‚Äôre non-technical and you have an idea you‚Äôre working on, you‚Äôre facing a bigger challenge than other founders.
Based on some [analysis](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/what-do-people-want-in-a-co-founder) from October 2021, we
found that the most in-demand founders on the platform are technical without an idea. This means the competition will be
high, so it‚Äôs *extra* important that your profile stands out.

One of the most effective ways to make yourself stand out is to show any progress you‚Äôve been able to make on your idea
without a technical co-founder. Have you created a no-code or low-code MVP? Do you have users, or have you done any user
research? Have you raised money? Demonstrating progress will make you and your company more compelling to technical
candidates.¬†

presentations, but are also working with them on slightly longer decks to use in follow-up conversations with investors.

[I‚Äôve written about pitching before](http://www.aaronkharris.com/advice-on-pitching), and realized that what we were
missing was a clear template for how founders should lay out their stories through slides. The deck below is a template
for how I think companies should build seed decks. While the main target for this template is a company raising its seed
round, the deck is not all that different from best practices for a Series A deck - which we‚Äôll release next.

The key point to remember here is that founders should strive for clarity and concision. This is not the right place to
write a treatise on your market or world philosophy. The simple truth is that there isn‚Äôt very much meaningful detail to
explore for most seed stage companies. When founders pretend that there is, their stories get muddled, and the investors
get lost.

Focus on narrative. The rest is commentary. (see footnote)

![template-3](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-2.jpeg)

This is the title page. It has the name of your company, and a one line description of what you do.

This is the only place in the deck where you can only have 1 slide for what you need to show. Any of the other slides in
this deck should be treated as a first slide of a set. If you can keep the set to n=1, that‚Äôs ideal, but if you need
more, that‚Äôs ok. You probably don‚Äôt want any set here where n \> 3. This is a seed deck, remember.

![template-4](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-3.jpeg)

This is where you clearly state the problem. Particulars of how this problem impacts real world people/businesses are
valuable.

![template-5](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-4.jpeg)

This is the solution. You want to explain what you do very clearly, in as few words as possible. Describe the concrete
benefits you provide

![template-6](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-5.jpeg)

Show off your traction (if you have it). Make the numbers clear and meaningful. It‚Äôs unlikely your curve will be this
smooth. That‚Äôs ok.

Add some context next to the chart if you‚Äôve got some great stats you want to add.

![template-7](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-6.jpeg)

Got more metrics? Awesome\! Add them\!

Trick slide\! Revenue would be better here, but this is ok.

![template-8](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-7.jpeg)

Tell the investor what makes you so special, what makes this work, what your insights are. This might take more than one
slide.

![template-9](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-8.jpeg)

Business model is important. You probably don‚Äôt know all the details yet, but you should know a lot of them. Lay it out.
If you need more space to dig into something complicated, add slides.

![template-10](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-9.jpeg)

What‚Äôs the market here? Is it going to be big? Will you make it big? How much money are you going to make off this
thing? Convince the investor that they‚Äôre going to make lots of money with you

![template-11](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-10.jpeg)

Team\! So important at seed. Talk about what makes your team particularly well suited to the problem. This should be
about founders. Nobody cares about your advisors.

![template-12](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YC-seed-deck-template-11.jpeg)

Tell the investor how much money you need, and what it gets you. If you can lay out where you‚Äôll be inside of a year,
which should make you Series A ready, that‚Äôs powerful

are now 16,000 co-founder profiles on the platform. Potential co-founders have sent 130,000 matching invites through the
platform, and, with a 25% acceptance rate, we‚Äôve seen a total of 33,000 matches.

We now have enough data to identify some interesting trends among our co-founder profiles and matches.

# Who are the founders on our platform?

  - 40% of profiles are from the U.S., with 60% representing another 145 countries.
  - 42% identify as technical (i.e. ‚Äúa programmer, scientist, or engineer who can build the product without outside
    assistance‚Äù).
  - 43% are working full-time (40+ hours/week) on their startup, 22% are part-time (20-40 hours/week), and the remaining
    spend \<20 hours/week on their startup.
  - Of the founders who are not currently working on a startup, 47% plan to start in the next 3 months, and another 21%
    plan to start in the next 6 months.
  - 13% identify as a woman.

# What do founders care about?

We give founders the option to mark their preferences for a co-founder across several attributes, including:

  - Whether they are technical
  - Areas of skill (*Product, Design, Engineering, Sales and Marketing, Operations*)
  - Their level of time commitment over the next few weeks (40+ hours/week, 20-40 hours/week, or less)
  - Their location
  - Whether they have shared interests (e.g. *B2B/Enterprise, Biotech,* etc.)

Founders also indicate how important each attribute is: whether it‚Äôs a must-have, whether they have a preference but are
flexible, or whether they don‚Äôt care at all.

The two most important attributes: **79% of founders care that their co-founder can commit a certain number of hours
over the next few weeks**, and **74% of founders prefer to have shared interests with their co-founder.** However,
only 15% and 13% see these attributes as must-haves, respectively.

The least important attribute? **50% of founders don‚Äôt care where their co-founder is located, perhaps a sign of the
(newly remote) times.**\\n\\n

# What industries are founders interested in?

Each founder can select interests from the following list: *Agriculture/Agtech, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented
Reality/Virtual Reality (ARVR), B2B/Enterprise, Biomedical/Biotech, Blockchain, Consumer, E-Commerce, Education/Edtech,
Energy, Entertainment, Financial/Fintech, Government, Hardware, Hard Tech, Healthcare, Marketplace, Non-Profit.*

The top 6 most popular interests:

  - *B2B/Enterprise* (36% of founders indicate interest)
  - *Consumer* (34%)
  - *AI* (34%)
  - *Marketplace* (32%)
  - *Fintech* (29%)
  - *E-Commerce* (29%)

Most founders select several interests; the median number of interests selected is 3. Interestingly, the most popular
interests among founders who pick only 1 interest look different:

  - *B2B/Enterprise* (17%)
  - *Fintech* (13%)
  - *Edtech* (12%)
  - *Consumer* (11%)
  - *Healthcare* (7%)
  - *AI* (7%)

# What skills are founders interested in?

Founders on the co-founder matching platform can claim responsibility in five areas of skill: *Product, Design,
Engineering, Sales and Marketing, Operations.*

  - 65% of founders do *Product*
  - 57% of founders do *Operations*
  - 52% of founders do *Sales and Marketing*
  - 37% of founders do *Design*
  - 31% of founders do *Engineering*

Here‚Äôs what founders want from their co-founder:

  - 62% of founders prefer a co-founder who does *Engineering*
  - 42% of founders prefer a co-founder who does *Product*
  - 39% of founders prefer a co-founder who does *Design*
  - 37% of founders prefer a co-founder who does *Sales and Marketing*
  - 28% of founders prefer a co-founder who does *Operations*

Engineers seem to be in high demand. Among founders who do not do *Engineering*, **80% prefer a co-founder who does
*Engineering***. Even engineers themselves are looking for more engineers: **44% of *Engineering* founders prefer a
co-founder who does *Engineering***.

Engineers are also looking for complementary skills though: **74% of *Engineering* founders prefer a co-founder who does
*Sales and Marketing***, and **53% of *Engineering* founders prefer a co-founder who does *Operations***.

# Who‚Äôs actually matching?

  - **Founders** on the platform have an average of **3.6 matches per person.**
  - **Engineers** on the platform have an average of **4.8 matches per person.**
  - **Founders who aren‚Äôt married to an idea** have an average of **5.1 matches per person.**

The majority of matches (68%) are made up of a technical founder paired with a non-technical founder. A bigger majority
of matches (72%) are made up of founders with at least one shared interest. An even greater portion of matches (73%) are
made up of a founder with an idea they‚Äôre working on paired with a founder not glued to an idea.

55% of matches comprise founders located in the same country. 69% of matches are between founders in the same continent,
and 61% of matches are composed of founders located within 3 time zones of each other. The rest, apparently, are from
all over the world.

73% of matches contain at least one full-time founder, and 92% of matches contain at least one founder who is ‚Äúactive‚Äù
(working on a startup idea now) rather than ‚Äúaspiring‚Äù (plan to work on a startup later).

Finally, it seems that founders on the site are extremely active: 75% of all matches are accepted within 4.5 days of the
initial invitation, and **50% of matches are accepted within 22 hours.** Of the matches where founders indicate having
met up either online or in person, **50% met within 6.2 days.**

In August of 2021, Christina Czap, co-founder and CEO of [**Seer**](https://www.helloseer.com/) (YC W21), found herself
badly in need of a technical co-founder. Seer, which raised $2.3M to help retail salespeople create shoppable Lookbooks,
was receiving incredible customer interest and couldn‚Äôt keep up with the inbound demand.

At the suggestion of her group partners at YC, Christina made a profile on YC‚Äôs [co-founder matching
platform](http://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching). Three months and many calls later, Seer had a new CTO: Gal
Vered, a former PM at Google.

Gal had been using co-founder matching since July. Although he was initially skeptical of the platform, he eventually
met up with 46 potential co-founders, and found the perfect fit with Seer.

![](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/asdfasd.jpeg)The co-founders of Seer (YC W21), Gal Vered and
Christina Czap.

We launched the co-founder matching platform earlier this year to help founders find their co-founders. When you sign
up, you tell us about yourself and what you‚Äôre looking for, and we show you profiles that most closely match your ideal
co-founder. If you message a candidate and they accept, we match the two of you.

Co-founder matching has also seen success with brand-new companies. Three pairs of co-founders met through the platform
earlier this year, worked together on trial projects, became fully committed co-founders, applied to YC, and were
accepted into the Summer 2021 batch\!

[**Sequin**](https://www.sequincard.com/) (YC S21) is one of these companies. Vrinda Gupta had left her job after
launching credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve at Visa to work on a product to help women build credit. She
spent a year working as a solo founder, and, in that time, raised a pre-seed and built an MVP. She knew she needed a
technical co-founder who was mission driven, had fintech expertise, and was in it for the long haul.

![](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sequin.jpeg)Sequin (YC S21) co-founders, Vrinda Gupta and
Mark Thomas.

That person was Mark Thomas. He had ten years of engineering experience at Paypal, cared deeply about gender equity, and
spent six years as CTO of family-oriented startups. They had an instant connection and arranged to meet in person soon
after. Vrinda recalls, ‚ÄúWe met the day after we matched, and the day after, and then the day after that.‚Äù

Together, they went through YC‚Äôs batch this summer and [raised
$5.7M](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2021/09/15/debit-card-startup-builds-credit-for-women/?sh=6283b60b3c67).

[**Kiwi Biosciences**](https://www.kiwibiosciences.com/) (YC S21) has a similar story. Anjie Liu started the company to
solve her own pains with irritable bowel syndrome. She had a founding scientist to tackle R\&D, but wanted a co-founder
to help her build a consumer brand and commercialize the product.

![](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kiwi.jpeg)Anjie Liu and David Hachuel, co-founders of Kiwi
Biosciences (YC S21).

When Anjie saw David Hachuel‚Äôs profile on YC co-founder matching, she knew that he was ‚Äúexactly what \[she\] was looking
for.‚Äù David had previously sold a startup in the same space, and was immediately interested in her idea.

They took a very structured approach to co-founder matching. Both founders answered all 50 questions posed in [First
Round‚Äôs co-founder
questionnaire](https://proof-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/firstround/50%20Questions%20for%20Co-Founders.pdf). They found deep
alignment on ‚Äúall the important things‚Äù (conflict resolution, vision for culture, etc.). When their month-long trial
ended and it came time to say go or no-go, the decision was easy.

Anjie and David worked remotely for four months and finally met in person after getting into YC. They went through YC
and [raised
$1.5M](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/kiwi-bio-aims-to-free-irritable-bowel-syndrome-sufferers-from-restrictive-diets/).

We‚Äôre ecstatic about the companies who met through our co-founder matching and we‚Äôre excited to see the platform
continue to grow and support more awesome founders in the future\!

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html)

April 2005  
  
This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are giving [seed funding](http://ycombinator.com/) to a bunch of new
startups. It's an experiment because we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That's why we're
doing it during the summer‚Äîso even college students can participate.  
  
We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful startups. And we know from experience that some
undergrads are as capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders has been creeping downward. We're
trying to find the lower bound.  
  
The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications. We expected to divide them into two categories,
promising and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising people with unpromising ideas. \[1\]

### **The Artix Phase**

We should have expected this. It's very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that
a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.  
  
Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started. In January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company
called Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect, I wonder how we could have wasted our time on
anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially [excited](http://www.knoedlergallery.com/) about being on the Web even
now, ten years later. They don't want to have their stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. \[2\]  
  
Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on earth. They didn't become art dealers after a difficult
choice between that and a career in the hard sciences. Most of them had never seen the Web before we came to tell them
why they should be on it. Some didn't even have computers. It doesn't do justice to the situation to describe it as a
hard *sell*; we soon sank to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries even to do that.  
  
Gradually it dawned on us that instead of trying to make Web sites for people who didn't want them, we could make sites
for people who did. In fact, software that would let people who wanted sites make their own. So we ditched Artix and
started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores. That one succeeded.  
  
We're in good company here. Microsoft was not the first company Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either. The first was
called Traf-o-data. It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.  
  
In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix. I dragged him into it. \[3\] But there were moments when he was
optimistic. And if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we
should not be surprised that hackers aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.

### **The Still Life Effect**

Why does this happen? Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?  
  
Let's look at our case. One reason we had such a lame idea was that it was the first thing we thought of. I was in New
York trying to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually quite easy), so I was haunting galleries
anyway. When I learned about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two. Make Web sites for galleries‚Äîthat's the
ticket\!  
  
If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days
considering different ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head. You'd think. But people don't.
In fact, this is a constant problem when you're painting still lifes. You plonk down a bunch of stuff on a table, and
maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to look interesting. But you're so impatient to get started painting that
ten minutes of rearranging feels very long. So you start painting. Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring
at it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and boring composition, but by then it's too late.  
  
Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small ones. You set up a still life to make a quick sketch
when you have a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it. I once spent a month painting three versions of a
still life I set up in about four minutes. At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought I'd already put in so much
time that it was too late to change.  
  
So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at
each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be *the* idea.  
  
How do we fix that? I don't think we should discard plunging. Plunging into an idea is a good thing. The solution is at
the other end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good.  
  
This is clearest in the case of names. Viaweb was originally called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product
called that. We were so attached to our name that we offered him *5% of the company* if he'd let us have it. But he
wouldn't, so we had to think of another. \[4\] The best we could do was Viaweb, which we disliked at first. It was like
having a new mother. But within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and old-fashioned.  
  
If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea. A name only has
one point of attachment into your head. An idea for a company gets woven into your thoughts. So you must consciously
discount for that. Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your idea in the harsh light of morning and
ask: is this something people will pay for? Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing people will pay most
for?

### **Muck**

The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common. Putting galleries on the Web seemed cool.  
  
One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass.
Meaning that unpleasant work pays. And more to the point here, vice versa. Work people like doesn't pay well, for
reasons of supply and demand. The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all,
because people like it so much they do it for free.  
  
When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business. I wanted to keep one foot in the art world. Big, big,
mistake. Going into business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it wholeheartedly, or not at all. The purpose
of a company, and a startup especially, is to make money. You can't have divided loyalties.  
  
Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose
only purpose is patent litigation. What I mean is, if you're starting a company that will do something cool, the aim had
better be to make money and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.  
  
It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident. Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to
happen at all.

### **Hyenas**

When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity. If you'd proposed at the time that we go into the
e-commerce business, we'd have found the idea terrifying. Surely a field like that would be dominated by fearsome
startups with five million dollars of VC money each. Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own in the
slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites for art galleries.  
  
We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety. As it turns out, VC-backed startups are not that fearsome. They're too
busy trying to spend all that [money](http://www.paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html) to get software written. In 1995,
the e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press releases, but not as measured in software. And really
it never was. The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just consulting companies pretending to be product
companies \[5\], and the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines of Perl scripts. Or could have
been implemented as a couple hundred lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines of C++ or
Java. Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.  
  
So why were we afraid? We felt we were good at programming, but we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious,
undifferentiated thing we called "business." In fact there is no such thing as "business." There's selling, promotion,
figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to
pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and so on. And the combination is not as hard as it seems, because some
tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated) are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others
(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination than any kind of special training.  
  
Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we were afraid of the lions. Except the lions turned out
not to have any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely qualified as carrion.

### **A Familiar Problem**

Sum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such a bad idea for a company. We did the first thing we
thought of; we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately chose an impoverished market to avoid
competition.  
  
Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see signs of all three. But the first is by far the
biggest problem. Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the things we could do, is *this* the one
with the best chance of making money?  
  
If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned to ask that. After the reception we got from art
dealers, we were ready to. This time, we thought, let's make something people want.  
  
Reading the *Wall Street Journal* for a week should give anyone ideas for two or three new startups. The articles are
full of descriptions of problems that need to be solved. But most of the applicants don't seem to have looked far for
ideas.  
  
We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games. We were not far off: this was the second most common.
The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar, a dating site, and Friendster. Maybe there is some new
killer app to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around in this fog when there are valuable,
unsolved problems lying about in the open for anyone to see. Why did no one propose a new scheme for micropayments? An
ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't believe we've considered every alternative. And newspapers and magazines are
(literally) dying for a solution.  
  
Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want? I think the problem with many, as with people in their
early twenties generally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump through predefined hoops. They've
spent 15-20 years solving problems other people have set for them. And how much time deciding what problems would be
good to solve? Two or three course projects? They're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.  
  
But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training. Or more precisely, the effect of grading. To make grading
efficient, everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to be decided in advance. It would be great if
schools taught students how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't know how you'd run such a class
in practice.

### **Copper and Tin**

The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned. I know that from experience. Hackers can learn to
make things customers want. \[6\]  
  
This is a controversial view. One expert on "entrepreneurship" told me that any startup had to include business people,
because only they could focus on what customers wanted. I'll probably alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I
have to risk it, because his email was such a perfect example of this view:

> 80% of MIT spinoffs succeed *provided* they have at least one management person in the team at the start. The business
> person represents the "voice of the customer" and that's what keeps the engineers and product development on track.

This is, in my opinion, a crock. Hackers are perfectly capable of hearing the voice of the customer without a business
person to amplify the signal for them. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad students in computer science, which
presumably makes them "engineers." Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business guy whispering in
their ears what customers wanted? It seems to me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who
obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting started.  
  
The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out. But that's
something you can learn quickly. It's like seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous picture. As soon as someone
tells you there's a rabbit as well as a duck, it's hard not to see it.  
  
And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving, giving customers what they want is easy. Anyone who
can write an optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, once they *choose* to focus on that
problem. And once you apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions, you can create wealth very
rapidly.  
  
That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that's beneath them. Big companies try to hire the
right person for the job. Startups win because they don't‚Äîbecause they take people so smart that they would in a big
company be doing "research," and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think
Einstein designing refrigerators. \[7\]  
  
If you want to learn what people want, read Dale Carnegie's\_How to Win Friends and Influence People.\_ \[8\] When a
friend recommended this book, I couldn't believe he was serious. But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was
right. It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience: how to see things from other people's point of
view, instead of thinking only of yourself.  
  
Most smart people don't do that very well. But adding this ability to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper. The
result is bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.  
  
A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful. And not just at making
money: look what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.  
  
Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the same way that not drinking anything would teach you how
much you depend on water. But it would be more convenient for all involved if the Summer Founders didn't learn this on
our dime‚Äîif they could skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers wanted. That, I think, is going
to be the real experiment this summer. How long will it take them to grasp this?  
  
We decided we ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we'd been thinking about what to print on the back. Till now we'd
been planning to use

> If you can read this, I should be working.

but now we've decided it's going to be

> Make something people want.

### **Notes**

\[1\] SFP applicants: please don't assume that not being accepted means we think your idea is bad. Because we want to
keep the number of startups small this first summer, we're going to have to turn down some good proposals too.  
  
\[2\] Dealers try to give each customer the impression that the stuff they're showing him is something special that only
a few people have seen, when in fact it may have been sitting in their racks for years while they tried to unload it on
buyer after buyer.  
  
\[3\] On the other hand, he was skeptical about Viaweb too. I have a precise measure of that, because at one point in
the first couple months we made a bet: if he ever made a million dollars out of Viaweb, he'd get his ear pierced. We
didn't let him[off](http://www.paulgraham.com/pierced.html), either.  
  
\[4\] I wrote a program to generate all the combinations of "Web" plus a three letter word. I learned from this that
most three letter words are bad: Webpig, Webdog, Webfat, Webzit, Webfug. But one of them was Webvia; I swapped them to
make Viaweb.  
  
\[5\] It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings than by
selling recordings. But the margins are greater on products. So during the Bubble a lot of companies used consulting to
generate revenues they could attribute to the sale of products, because it made a better story for an IPO.  
  
\[6\] Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, see what
they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can
be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."  
  
\[7\] You need to offer especially large rewards to get great people to do tedious work. That's why startups always pay
equity rather than just salary.

[*http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html*](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html)

July 2013

One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be
founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a
better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist.
\[1\]

Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves,
but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had
before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and
laborious process to get it going.

### Recruit

The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have
to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them.

Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone
could have sat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they're famous within YC for aggressive early user
acquisition.

Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of potential users in the other companies we've funded, and
none took better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the term "Collison installation" for the technique they
invented. More diffident founders ask "Will you try our beta?" and if the answer is yes, they say "Great, we'll send you
a link." But the Collison brothers weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say "Right then, give
me your laptop" and set them up on the spot.

There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. One is a combination of shyness and
laziness. They'd rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected
by most of them. But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time
on sales and marketing. \[2\]

The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first. This can't be how the
big, famous startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth. We
encourage every startup to measure their progress by weekly [growth rate](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html). If you
have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% a week. And while 110 may not seem much better than 100,
if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big the numbers get. After a year you'll have 14,000 users,
and after 2 years you'll have 2 million.

You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down
eventually. But if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users manually and then gradually switch to
less manual methods. \[3\]

Airbnb is a classic example of this technique. Marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take
heroic measures at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door in New York, recruiting new users and
helping existing ones improve their listings. When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture them with rolly bags,
because when they showed up for tuesday dinners they'd always just flown back from somewhere.

### **Fragile**

Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and
engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure.

That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb. Almost all startups are fragile initially. And that's one of
the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.
They unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones. They're like someone looking at a newborn
baby and concluding "there's no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything."

It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup. They always get things wrong. It's even ok if
investors dismiss your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth. The big danger is that you'll dismiss
your startup yourself. I've seen it happen. I often have to encourage founders who don't see the full potential of what
they're building. Even Bill Gates made that mistake. He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting
Microsoft. He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a
fraction of the size it turned out to be. \[4\]

The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this company taking over the world?" but "how big could this
company get if the founders did the right things?" And the right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at
the time. Microsoft can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys in Albuquerque writing Basic
interpreters for a market of a few thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect that was the optimal
path to dominating microcomputer software. And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were en route to
the big time as they were taking "professional" photos of their first hosts' apartments. They were just trying to
survive. But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big market.

How do you find users to recruit manually? If you build something to solve [your own
problems](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html), then you only have to find your peers, which is usually
straightforward. Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate the most promising vein of users. The
usual way to do that is to get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted launch, and then to observe
which kind seem most enthusiastic, and seek out more like them. For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that a lot of the
earliest Pinterest users were interested in design, so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well. \[5\]

### **Delight**

You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy. For as long as they could
(which turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a hand-written thank you note. Your first users
should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made. And you in turn should be racking your
brains to think of new ways to delight them.

Why do we have to teach startups this? Why is it counterintuitive for founders? Three reasons, I think.

One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers, and customer service is not part of the training of
engineers. You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not be slavishly attentive to individual users
like some kind of salesperson. Ironically, part of the reason engineering is traditionally averse to handholding is that
its traditions date from a time when engineers were less powerful ‚Äî when they were only in charge of their narrow domain
of building things, rather than running the whole show. You can be ornery when you're Scotty, but not when you're Kirk.

Another reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers is that they worry it won't scale. But when founders
of larval startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state they have nothing to lose. Maybe if they go
out of their way to make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to do so much for. That would be a
great problem to have. See if you can make it happen. And incidentally, when it does, you'll find that delighting
customers scales better than you expected. Partly because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than you
would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers will by then have permeated your culture.

I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying too hard to make their initial users happy.

But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing how attentive they could be to their users is that
they've never experienced such attention themselves. Their standards for customer service have been set by the companies
they've been customers of, which are mostly big ones. Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written note after you buy a
laptop. He can't. But you can. That's one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big company
can. \[6\]

Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience, it's interesting in a very
pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users.

### **Experience**

I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had
already done it: insanely great. Steve wasn't just using "insanely" as a synonym for "very." He meant it more literally
‚Äî that one should focus on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be considered pathological.

All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably doesn't surprise would-be founders. What novice
founders don't get is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup. When Steve Jobs started using that phrase,
Apple was already an established company. He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even packaging ‚Äî such is the
nature of obsession) should be insanely well designed and manufactured. That's not hard for engineers to grasp. It's
just a more extreme version of designing a robust and elegant product.

What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great
morphs into as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a startup's life. It's not the product that
should be insanely great, but the experience of being your user. The product is just one component of that. For a big
company it's necessarily the dominant one. But you can and should give users an insanely great experience with an early,
incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the difference with attentiveness.

Can, perhaps, but should? Yes. Over-engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth
rolling. For most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop that makes the product good. Making a
better mousetrap is not an atomic operation. Even if you start the way most successful startups have, by building
something you yourself need, the first thing you build is never quite right. And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection initially. In software, especially, it usually works
best to get something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility, and then see what they do with it.
Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users is always inaccurate,
even if you're one of them. \[7\]

The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. When you're so big
you have to resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users' homes and offices and watch them use
your stuff like you did when there were only a handful of them.

### **Fire**

Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market. It's like keeping a fire contained at
first to get it really hot before adding more logs.

That's what Facebook did. At first it was just for Harvard students. In that form it only had a potential market of a
few thousand people, but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of them signed up. After Facebook
stopped being for Harvard students, it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while. When I interviewed
Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school, doing
that made students feel the site was their natural home.

Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has to start in a subset of the market, but this can work
for other startups as well. It's always worth asking if there's a subset of the market in which you can get a critical
mass of users quickly. \[8\]

Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously. They build something for themselves and their
friends, who happen to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could offer it to a broader market. The
strategy works just as well if you do it unconsciously. The biggest danger of not being consciously aware of this
pattern is for those who naively discard part of it. E.g. if you don't build something for yourself and your friends, or
even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your friends are not early adopters, you'll no longer have a
perfect initial market handed to you on a platter.

Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups. They're more open to new things both by nature and
because, having just been started, they haven't made all their choices yet. Plus when they succeed they grow fast, and
you with them. It was one of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of making YC big) that B2B
startups now have an instant market of hundreds of other startups ready at hand.

### **Meraki**

For [hardware startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/hw.html) there's a variant of doing things that don't scale that we
call "pulling a Meraki." Although we didn't fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris's grad students, so we know
their history. They got started by doing something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers themselves.

Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't. The minimum order for a factory production run is
usually several hundred thousand dollars. Which can put you in a catch-22: without a product you can't generate the
growth you need to raise the money to manufacture your product. Back when hardware startups had to rely on investors for
money, you had to be pretty convincing to overcome this. The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely, preorders) has
helped a lot. But even so I'd advise startups to pull a Meraki initially if they can. That's what Pebble did. The
Pebbles [assembled](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/eric.jpg?t=1688221954&) the first several hundred
watches themselves. If they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have sold $10 million worth of
watches when they did go on Kickstarter.

Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware
startups. You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you learn things you'd never have known
otherwise. Eric Migicovsky of Pebble said one of the things he learned was "how valuable it was to source good screws."
Who knew?

### **Consult**

Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as
if they were consultants building something just for that one user. The initial user serves as the form for your mold;
keep tweaking till you fit their needs perfectly, and you'll usually find you've made something other users want too.
Even if there aren't many of them, there are probably adjacent territories that have more. As long as you can find just
one user who really needs something and can act on that need, you've got a toehold in making something people want, and
that's as much as any startup needs initially. \[9\]

Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale. But (like other ways of bestowing one's favors
liberally) it's safe to do it so long as you're not being paid to. That's where companies cross the line. So long as
you're a product company that's merely being extra attentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if you don't
solve all their problems. But when they start paying you specifically for that attentiveness ‚Äî when they start paying
you by the hour ‚Äî they expect you to do everything.

Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm users is to use your software yourselves on their
behalf. We did that at Viaweb. When we approached merchants asking if they wanted to use our software to make online
stores, some said no, but they'd let us make one for them. Since we would do anything to get users, we did. We felt
pretty lame at the time. Instead of organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying to sell luggage and
pens and men's shirts. But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would feel to
merchants to use our software. Sometimes the feedback loop was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some
merchant's site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, so I'd spend a couple hours implementing it and then resume
building the site.

### **Manual**

There's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software, but are your software. When you only have a small
number of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan to automate later. This lets you
launch faster, and when you do finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what to build because
you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.

When manual components look to the user like software, this technique starts to have aspects of a practical joke. For
example, the way Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts to its first users was that the founders manually signed
them up for traditional merchant accounts behind the scenes.

Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find someone with a problem that needs solving and you can
solve it manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then gradually automate the bottlenecks. It would be
a little frightening to be solving users' problems in a way that wasn't yet automatic, but less frightening than the far
more common case of having something automatic that doesn't yet solve anyone's problems.

### **Big**

I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't work: the Big Launch. I occasionally meet founders who
seem to believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and that they'll make it big if and only if
they're launched with sufficient initial velocity. They want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications, with
embargoes. And on a tuesday, of course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch something.

It's easy to see how little launches matter. Think of some successful startups. How many of their launches do you
remember? All you need from a launch is some initial core of users. How well you're doing a few months later will depend
more on how happy you made those users than how many there were of them. \[10\]

So why do founders think launches matter? A combination of solipsism and laziness. They think what they're building is
so great that everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up. Plus it would be so much less work if you could get
users merely by broadcasting your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time. But even if what you're building
really is great, getting users will always be a gradual process ‚Äî partly because great things are usually also novel,
but mainly because users have other things to think about.

Partnerships too usually don't work. They don't work for startups in general, but they especially don't work as a way to
get growth started. It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to believe that a partnership with a big company
will be their big break. Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that was way more work than we expected,
and we ended up getting practically nothing out of it. \[11\]

It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially. You have to make an extraordinary *effort* initially. Any
strategy that omits the effort ‚Äî whether it's expecting a big launch to get you users, or a big partner ‚Äî is ipso facto
suspect.

### **Vector**

The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop
thinking of startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of them as pairs of what you're going to build,
plus the unscalable thing(s) you're going to do initially to get the company going.

It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way, because now that there are two components you can try
to be imaginative about the second as well as the first. But in most cases the second component will be what it usually
is ‚Äî recruit users manually and give them an overwhelmingly good experience ‚Äî and the main benefit of treating startups
as vectors will be to remind founders they need to work hard in two dimensions. \[12\]

In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do
to get started are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently for the better. If you have to be
aggressive about user acquisition when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're big. If you have to
manufacture your own hardware, or use your software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have learned
otherwise. And most importantly, if you have to work hard to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll
keep doing it when you have a lot.

### **Notes**

\[1\] Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically. He wrote "If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or
pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad
hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods."

\[2\] Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit. And no, you can't avoid doing sales by hiring someone to
do it for you. You have to do sales yourself initially. Later you can hire a real salesperson to replace you.

\[3\] The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size helps you grow. Patrick Collison wrote "At some point,
there was a very noticeable change in how Stripe felt. It tipped from being this boulder we had to push to being a train
car that in fact had its own momentum."

\[4\] One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders is by calibrating their ambitions, because we know
exactly how a lot of successful startups looked when they were just getting started.

\[5\] If you're building something for which you can't easily get a small set of users to observe ‚Äî e.g. enterprise
software ‚Äî and in a domain where you have no connections, you'll have to rely on cold calls and introductions. But
should you even be working on such an idea?

\[6\] Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into in the beginning. They want so much to seem big that
they imitate even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual users. This seems to them more
"professional." Actually it's better to embrace the fact that you're small and use whatever advantages that brings.

\[7\] Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because users' needs often change in response to what you
build for them. Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets on it, because the arrival of
your new microcomputer causes someone to invent the spreadsheet.

\[8\] If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up quickest and those that will pay the most, it's usually
best to pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters. They'll have a better influence on your product,
and they won't make you expend as much effort on sales. And though they have less money, you don't need that much to
maintain your target growth rate early on.

\[9\] Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making something that was really only useful for one user. But
those are usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders. So if it's not obvious you'd be making something for a market
of one, don't worry about that danger.

\[10\] There may even be an inverse correlation between launch magnitude and success. The only launches I remember are
famous flops like the Segway and Google Wave. Wave is a particularly alarming example, because I think it was actually a
great idea that was killed partly by its overdone launch.

\[11\] Google grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn't a partnership. Yahoo was their customer.

\[12\] It will also remind founders that an idea where the second component is empty ‚Äî an idea where there is nothing
you can do to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit manually ‚Äî is probably a bad idea, at
least for those founders.

August 2013

When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it's usually because they try to lift with their back. The right way
to lift heavy things is to let your legs do the work. Inexperienced founders make the same mistake when trying to
convince investors. They try to convince with their pitch. Most would be better off if they let their startup do the
work ‚Äî if they started by understanding why their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this well to
investors.

Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful. But that test is not as simple as it sounds. In
startups, as in a lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power law, but in startups the curve is
startlingly steep. The big successes are so big they [dwarf](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html) the rest. And since
there are only a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat "big success" as if it were binary.
Most are interested in you if you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the 15 big successes, and
otherwise not. \[1\]

(There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company with a high probability of being moderately successful.
But angel investors like big successes too.)

How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes? You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market,
and (usually) some evidence of success so far.

### **Formidable**

The most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem
like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change. \[2\] Every startup has reasons both to
invest and not to invest. If investors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if not they focus on the
latter. For example, it might be a rich market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed with you as
founders, they say they want to invest because it's a rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the
slow sales cycle.

They're not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or
dislike startups. If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more. But don't be too smug about this weakness of
theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone does.

There is a role for ideas of course. They're fuel for the fire that starts with liking the founders. Once investors like
you, you'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying "yes, and you could also do x." (Whereas when they don't like
you, they'll be saying "but what about y?")

But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn't a word most people use in
conversation much, I should explain what it means. A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want,
regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be
confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident.

There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable ‚Äî some because they actually are very formidable
and just let it show, and others because they are more or less con artists. \[3\] But most founders, including many who
will go on to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming formidable the first time they try
fundraising. What should they do? \[4\]

What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good
at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence. If you try to act like something you're not, you'll just
end up in an uncanny valley. You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.

### **Truth**

The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth. How formidable you seem isn't a
constant. It varies depending on what you're saying. Most people can seem confident when they're saying "one plus one is
two," because they know it's true. The most diffident person would be puzzled and even slightly contemptuous if they
told a VC "one plus one is two" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good at seeming
formidable is that they can do this with the sentence "we're going to make a billion dollars a year." But you can do the
same, if not with that sentence with some fairly impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.

That's the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to
investors they'll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your
confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money.
\[5\] But if it is, you'll be telling the truth when you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense that.
You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand something well and tell the truth about it.

To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you're not a domain expert,
you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the
Dunning-Kruger effect. Which in fact it will usually be. And investors can tell fairly quickly whether you're a domain
expert by how well you answer their questions. Know everything about your market. \[6\]

Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things they're not convinced of themselves? Partly because
we've all been trained to.

When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad school, one of their fellow students was on the
receiving end of a question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today. When the unfortunate fellow got to his
last slide, the professor burst out:

> Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?

One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to
say. If you have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if you only have one page of ideas. Even if
you have no ideas. You have to produce something. And all too many startups go into fundraising in the same spirit. When
they think it's time to raise money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their startup. Most never think
of pausing beforehand to ask whether what they're saying is actually convincing, because they've all been trained to
treat the need to present as a given ‚Äî as an area of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs be
spread, however thinly.

The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It's when
you can convince investors, and not before. \[7\]

And unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors if you're not convinced yourself. They're far
better at detecting bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're producing it unknowingly. If you try to
convince investors before you've convinced yourself, you'll be wasting both your time.

But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time. It will force you to organize
your thoughts. To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you'll have to figure out why it's worth
investing in. And if you can do that you'll end up with more than added confidence. You'll also have a provisional
roadmap of how to succeed.

### **Market**

Notice I've been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth investing in, rather than whether it's going to
succeed. No one knows whether a startup is going to succeed. And it's a good thing for investors that this is so,
because if you could know in advance whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be the future price,
and there would be no room for investors to make money. Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and
against pretty long odds.

So to prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove you're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently
good bet. What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet? In addition to formidable founders, you need a plausible path to
owning a big piece of a big market. Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors think of them as markets. If
there are x number of customers who'd pay an average of $y per year for what you're making, then the total addressable
market, or TAM, of your company is $xy. Investors don't expect you to collect all that money, but it's an upper bound on
how big you can get.

Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable by you. But the market doesn't have to be big yet,
nor do you necessarily have to be in it yet. Indeed, it's often better to start in a
[small](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) market that will either turn into a big one or from which you can move into a
big one. There just has to be some plausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a few years down the
line.

The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the age of the startup. A three month old company at Demo
Day only needs to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns out. Whereas a two year old company
raising a series A round needs to be able to show the experiment worked. \[8\]

But every company that gets really big is "lucky" in the sense that their growth is due mostly to some external wave
they're riding, so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify some specific trend you'll benefit
from. Usually you can find this by asking "why now?" If this is such a great idea, why hasn't someone else already done
it? Ideally the answer is that it only recently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one else has
noticed yet.

Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic interpreters. But by starting there they were perfectly
poised to expand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers grew powerful enough to support one. And
microcomputers turned out to be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted
in 1975.

But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation to think they would have seemed a great bet a few
months in, they probably didn't. Good, but not great. No company, however successful, ever looks more than a pretty good
bet a few months in. Microcomputers turned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and got lucky. But it
was by no means obvious that this was how things would play out. Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months in.
I don't know about startups in general, but at least half the startups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft
could have for being on a path to dominating a large market. And who can reasonably expect more of a startup than that?

### **Rejection**

If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you convince investors? Not always. A lot of VCs would have
rejected Microsoft. \[9\] Certainly some rejected Google. And getting rejected will put you in a slightly awkward
position, because as you'll see when you start fundraising, the most common question you'll get from investors will be
"who else is investing?" What do you say if you've been fundraising for a while and no one has committed yet? \[10\]

The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve this problem by giving investors the impression that
while no investors have committed yet, several are about to. This is arguably a permissible tactic. It's slightly
dickish of investors to care more about who else is investing than any other aspect of your startup, and misleading them
about how far along you are with other investors seems the complementary countermove. It's arguably an instance of
scamming a scammer. But I don't recommend this approach to most founders, because most founders wouldn't be able to
carry it off. This is the single most common lie told to investors, and you have to be really good at lying to tell
members of some profession the most common lie they're told.

If you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are) the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on,
and to explain why investors have turned you down and why they're mistaken. If you know you're on the right track, then
you also know why investors were wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also
the scariest. They all know about the VCs who rejected Google. If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed about having
been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with the verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about
you, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll probably also do a better job of presenting that aspect of
your startup. At the very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of being a gotcha left to be discovered
by the investors you're currently talking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery. \[11\]

This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both hard to bluff and who already believe most other
investors are conventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers. Raising money is not like applying to
college, where you can assume that if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State. Because the best
investors are much smarter than the rest, and the best startup ideas look initially like [bad
ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html), it's not uncommon for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs
except the best ones. That's what happened to Dropbox. Y Combinator started in Boston, and for the first 3 years we ran
alternating batches in Boston and Silicon Valley. Because Boston investors were so few and so timid, we used to ship
Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon Valley. Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those
Boston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them closed the deal. Yet another backup and syncing thing,
they all thought. A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round from Sequoia. \[12\]

### **Different**

Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines with the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders
from even considering the possibility of being certain of what they're saying. They think they're trying to convince
investors of something very uncertain ‚Äî that their startup will be huge ‚Äî and convincing anyone of something like that
must obviously entail some wild feat of salesmanship. But in fact when you raise money you're trying to convince
investors of something so much less speculative ‚Äî whether the company has all the elements of a good bet ‚Äî that you can
approach the problem in a qualitatively different way. You can convince yourself, then convince them.

And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language you used to convince yourself. You wouldn't use vague,
grandiose marketing-speak among yourselves. Don't use it with investors either. It not only doesn't work on them, but
seems a mark of incompetence. Just be concise. Many investors explicitly use that as a test, reasoning (correctly) that
if you can't explain your plans concisely, you don't really understand them. But even investors who don't have a rule
about this will be bored and frustrated by unclear explanations. \[13\]

So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable:

1.  Make something worth investing in.
2.  Understand why it's worth investing in.
3.  Explain that clearly to investors.

If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching
draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just
tell it.

### **Notes**

\[1\] There's no reason to believe this number is a constant. In fact it's our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase
it, by encouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn't have.

\[2\] Or more precisely, investors decide whether you're a loser or possibly a winner. If you seem like a winner, they
may then, depending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings with you to test whether that initial
impression holds up.

But if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next year or so. And when they decide you're a loser they
usually decide in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first meeting. Which explains the
astonished stories one always hears about VC inattentiveness. How could these people make investment decisions well when
they're checking their messages during startups' presentations? The solution to that mystery is that they've already
made the decision.

\[3\] The two are not mutually exclusive. There are people who are both genuinely formidable, and also really good at
acting that way.

\[4\] How can people who will go on to create giant companies not seem formidable early on? I think the main reason is
that their experience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as it were. Family, school, and jobs encourage
cooperation, not conquest. And it's just as well they do, because even being Genghis Khan is probably 99% cooperation.
But the result is that most people emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early twenties compressed into the
shape of the tube. Some find they have wings and start to spread them. But this takes a few years. In the beginning even
they don't know yet what they're capable of.

\[5\] In fact, change what you're doing. You're investing your own time in your startup. If you're not convinced that
what you're working on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on that?

\[6\] When investors ask you a question you don't know the answer to, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up,
but instead to explain how you'd figure out the answer. If you can work out a preliminary answer on the spot, so much
the better, but explain that's what you're doing.

\[7\] At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and
instead focus on their companies till about a week before. That way most reach the stage where they're sufficiently
convincing well before Demo Day. But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the option of deferring to a
later Demo Day.

\[8\] Founders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise the next round. There is a qualitative difference
in investors' attitudes. It's like the difference between being judged as a kid and as an adult. The next time you raise
money, it's not enough to be promising. You have to be delivering results.

So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage, investors treat them differently. At three months, a
growth graph is mostly evidence that the founders are effective. At two years, it has to be evidence of a promising
market and a company tuned to exploit it.

\[9\] By this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3 month old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there
would be investors who turned them down. Microsoft itself didn't raise outside money, and indeed the venture business
barely existed when they got started in 1975.

\[10\] The best investors rarely care who else is investing, but mediocre investors almost all do. So you can use this
question as a test of investor quality.

\[11\] To use this technique, you'll have to find out why investors who rejected you did so, or at least what they claim
was the reason. That may require asking, because investors don't always volunteer a lot of detail. Make it clear when
you ask that you're not trying to dispute their decision ‚Äî just that if there is some weakness in your plans, you need
to know about it. You won't always get a real reason out of them, but you should at least try.

\[12\] Dropbox wasn't rejected by all the East Coast VCs. There was one firm that wanted to invest but tried to lowball
them.

\[13\] Alfred Lin points out that it's doubly important for the explanation of a startup to be clear and concise,
because it has to convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner you talk to, but when that partner
re-tells it to colleagues.

We consciously optimize for this at YC. When we work with founders create a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine
how an investor would sell it to colleagues.

company touches 25% of all US real estate transactions and is valued at $1.5B. Founder and CEO [Aaron
King](https://twitter.com/a_w_king) and his team have expertly navigated fundraising and market cycles. We sat down with
Aaron to hear his insight into getting a business up and running with minimal outside funding and building through
volatile market conditions.¬†

**Why did you decide to raise minimal funding early in the company‚Äôs history?**

I never considered funding to be a requirement for building ‚Äî but I also didn't know much about fundraising early on in
the company‚Äôs history. Snapdocs was started as a side project a couple of years before ever thinking about applying to
YC. By the time I applied, we had a live product, customers, and revenue. Even after YC, we didn‚Äôt raise much
immediately. We stayed focused on building and then raised a seed round later in the year.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until three years later that we raised our Series A. By then, we had spent about $1MM of our seed round and
were at a $5MM revenue run rate. Around that time we started working with much larger customers, and it was clear we
would need more capital to be successful in this bigger market. So, we raised our Series A. After we closed the round,
our lead investor revealed how capital efficient we had been compared to our peers.

**Do you feel you had to ruthlessly prioritize when building the product because you didn't have the capital?**

Yes, and I‚Äôve learned that you should take the same approach even when you do have the capital to be less disciplined.
Back then, ruthless prioritization was our only option. We couldn‚Äôt afford to build features that weren‚Äôt essential.
There were always a hundred distractions that would result in a broader, less focused product. But our capital
constraints kept us focused on going deep with our paying customers. That helped us avoid the common trap of building
products no one wanted.¬†

It also meant that when we decided to build a product, we had to think about the smallest version of that product in
order to quickly ship. That helped ensure we had a short feedback loop from our users and ensure our resources were
continuously being invested in building the right features. Looking back, I‚Äôm amazed at how much we were able to
accomplish without spending much capital.

Being capital constrained forced good behaviors that served us well even after we raised more funding. We continue to be
thoughtful about every dollar we spend. But, there is a cost to this approach, and we‚Äôre paying for it today. We built
many things that weren't engineered for scale or flexibility. However, now we can afford to reengineer those unscalable
solutions because we built something people want.

**What did your product cycles look like before you raised your Series A?**¬†

We were always heavy on customer involvement when building product. We spent a lot of time in our customers‚Äô offices
watching them use what we were building and understanding their work. We also kept a lot of our prospects in the loop as
we built new features. Some of the best feedback came from people who had chosen to not yet work with us. Responding to
that feedback with a killer feature was a great way to ultimately get them on board.¬†

We built a lot of trust and rapport with these early customers, and the in-person interactions helped immensely. As a
result, they would call one of us the moment they thought there was a problem or if they thought a competitor was doing
something compelling. Customer churn for Snapdocs has always been incredibly low as a result.¬†

We created a disciplined product release process, even in those early days, but we were still able to move quickly. We
shipped code every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Customers were impressed by how quickly we could respond to
issues and feedback.¬†

Interestingly, not having too much pressure from investors early on allowed us to experiment more in an underappreciated
part of our market. The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) of our initial product was roughly only $20MM, but we
believed it would allow us to expand into more critical parts of the mortgage ecosystem. It was the type of opportunity
that would be hard to discover through market analysis or spreadsheet exercises. You had to get deep into the problem
set to see the opportunity and develop the right strategy ‚Äî and that ultimately worked to our advantage.¬†

**Founders need capital to hire employees. As a bootstrapped company, what was your strategy around hiring?**¬†

Hiring was hard, but we did a few things that worked well. Even before the company could afford full-time employees, I
worked with talented contractors. I also leaned on friends to help me work through both technical and business
challenges. Someone would come over and whiteboard with me or we‚Äôd get into the code and work through a problem.¬†

When I could afford to hire full-time employees, I treated them like founding team members. I was generous with equity
and shared everything about the potential and challenges of the business. We built a lot of trust as a small team.
Getting a few really good people into the company early on was foundational to the company‚Äôs success.¬†

The first person to join full time was an engineer I had worked with in a previous role (and one of the friends that
would help in those early days). The second and third hires were applicants from job postings on Hacker News. All three
turned out to be excellent. None of us initially had large networks in the startup world, so most of our early hiring
involved lots of interviews and hiring a few of the wrong people. We couldn‚Äôt attract well-known talent and took risks;
invested in people we thought had a lot of potential.¬†

One mistake I made in the early years was being too timid to approach more of the people I respected. I should have
tried to convince them to quit their successful jobs and join our small (yet risky at the time) startup. I‚Äôm fearless on
this approach now, but back then I was intimidated to try to convince a friend to join a company that might fail. In
hindsight I did them a disservice by not trying to recruit them. The truth is that these people are smart and you‚Äôre not
harming anyone by sharing your vision and the potential of the company with them. As long as you‚Äôre honest and
transparent about the inherent challenges, you should give them the opportunity to take a risk on you.¬†

As Snapdocs grew, it became easier to pull from the team‚Äôs networks. We continued to build a lot of trust within the
team, and they started referring their friends to apply. Eventually we attracted well-known investors, and that, along
with our culture and growth, made hiring easier.¬†

Because we were capital constrained, we also didn‚Äôt hire anyone until there was a clear and painful need. It made
running the company harder because we were all spread thin, but ultimately made us incredibly productive, as it meant we
were always working on the most important things.¬†

**How have you navigated different market conditions? When do you decide to react?**

A big part of our success has come from selectively ignoring some market changes, while reacting quickly to others. It
has always been a question of how the change aligns with our resources, vision, and north star metric of market share
growth.¬†

For example, the biggest and most dynamic change we regularly experience are fluctuations in the number of mortgages
that happen in a given month or year.This can change quickly based on a host of economic factors. When we are
well-resourced and growing fast, we can ignore some of those market downturns and stay focused on market share growth ‚Äî
knowing we have the momentum and capital to power through it. Other times we‚Äôve had to scale up or scale back based on
the size of the fluctuation.

But other market dynamics can change quickly too, like the industry‚Äôs appetite for new technologies and the competitive
landscape. There have been times when the market was demanding a technology but we believed there were underlying
factors in the industry that would prevent that tech from scaling. If we built the technology, it would pull resources
away from our priorities that drove us towards our long-term goals. And so, sometimes to the protests of our sales team,
we ignored it or invested minimally in these trendy areas. By doing so, we were able to stay focused on the things that
were truly going to transform the industry.¬†

It‚Äôs also worth noting that navigating change was relatively easy in the first few years of building the company. It was
a lot easier to adjust course on company direction or strategy when the team was smaller and could all fit in the same
room. The product cycles were relatively short and malleable. The cost of making a change was low.¬†

As the company has grown, we‚Äôve had to be a lot more thoughtful and methodical about changing the speed or direction of
the business as we react to market changes. The cost of making a change has increased a lot. Investments take longer to
play out. Changes to headcount take longer to scale up or down. There are more people on the team and more layers in the
organization to communicate the change through.

**In March 2020, Snapdocs made a huge shift because of changes you were seeing in the housing market. How did you
communicate this shift to your team and ensure their goals were aligned with the new priorities?**¬†

COVID accelerated demand for our product, but with that came a shift in what our customers wanted from a platform like
ours. We had to expand quickly to serve their needs, and we had to pivot our roadmap on a dime. It‚Äôs a testament to the
team that we were able to pull that off.¬†

To make decisions quickly and then communicate them, we worked in concentric circles. We started by discussing the
change in a smaller group of 3-4 people. This is where the hardest and messiest conversations took place. We moved
quickly to define the problems and opportunities and set a direction for the company. We then looped in the senior
leadership team for further discussion and to arm them with everything they needed to share the directional changes with
their teams. Finally, we held a company-wide meeting to share the new direction and answer questions. All of this
happened over the course of about 2 weeks.

Now, our business required more speed and flexibility as information was coming in and changing week on week. We dealt
with this by¬† temporary pods of 4-5 team members focused on solving specific challenges that would spin up for a few
weeks and then dissolve once the challenge was addressed. We also increased the frequency of our company wide all-hand
meetings from monthly to weekly so we could keep the whole company up to speed.¬†

Luckily we had a deep culture of transparency that goes back to the beginning of the company. We‚Äôve always tried to
share everything with our entire team ‚Äî our cash balance, monthly growth rate, burn, our biggest challenges. This got
harder as the team grew, but we‚Äôve largely continued this transparency to today. It‚Äôs much easier to be transparent in
times of great change if you've laid a foundation of trust and transparency in the past.¬†

We also worked hard to be intellectually honest about the growth we were experiencing. It‚Äôs easy to take credit when the
business accelerates, but our message to the team wasn't, ‚ÄúLook at how great we're doing.‚Äù The message was closer to,
‚ÄúThis industry works in cycles. We're in an up cycle now and that's great. There's going to be a down cycle. We don't
know when or how strong it's going to be. But we should not overly congratulate ourselves for the current situation,
just as we shouldn‚Äôt be too hard on ourselves when we‚Äôre fighting through an inevitable downturn in the future.‚Äù

**In 2021, Snapdocs**
[**announced**](https://www.snapdocs.com/resource-center/blog/announcing-our-150m-series-d-funding-round) **a Series D
round. How did this change your mentality around resources?**

It was clear that the pandemic would be an accelerator for our business, and we needed to move fast to stay ahead of the
market. We went from being frugal to raising larger rounds of capital and hiring seasoned executives who could help us
scale. It‚Äôs important for companies to evolve at the right points in time and ask themselves, ‚ÄúIs what I did yesterday
the thing that's going to get me to where I need to be tomorrow?‚Äù. We asked that question and decided we needed to
change parts of our culture and capital investment strategy if we wanted to win.

When we raised capital in 2021, transactions on Snapdocs had steadily increased to millions of closings a year and
thousands of lenders and title companies were using our technology every month. Demand for mortgages throughout the
pandemic was strong, and we deployed an intentional strategy of prioritizing effectiveness over efficiency. We needed to
get aggressive and expand our market position, which required capital.¬†

The market turned again later in the year, with demand for mortgages cooling. It was clear that it was time to go back
to some of our old ways of doing things. We ditched the motto of being effective over being efficient. This meant a
return to ruthless prioritization of our focus. We shifted away from investing so heavily in future scale as we wouldn‚Äôt
need to tap into these systems for a few years.

I find it helpful to remember that market fluctuations are normal and unavoidable. Startups should scale up at times and
scale back at others. It‚Äôs hard and painful. There‚Äôs nothing easy or enjoyable about being understaffed to meet customer
demand on one side, or needing to let team members go on the other. But these ups and downs are natural and a necessary
part of building an enduring company. In a startup, you‚Äôre always making hard decisions based on insufficient
information. You‚Äôre never going to be able to perfectly predict the future. You need to keep making the best decisions
you can ‚Äî knowing all the while that you may be wrong and need to change course again once the future becomes clearer.

[YC Hacks 2014](https://ychacks.devpost.com/submissions/25781-athelas). This month we started shipping our first devices
to patients and hospitals around the country. We learned a lot in the process and wanted to share a few thoughts here.

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-1.png" alt="athelas-1" width="1500" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098303" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-1.png)

The device is a low-cost imager that enables rapid blood diagnostics through computer vision instead of traditional
lab-based techniques. Going from a hacked together hardware prototype to shippable product (especially in the medical
field) was a progression in dimensionality at every stage, and it‚Äôs quite interesting now to look back at day 1.

The first version that began at the hackathon used a rubber piece and spherical magnifier attached to a smartphone
camera. A blood sample would be held (by a toilet paper roll) underneath, the camera would take a couple images, then
produce the computer vision rendered malaria cell counts. In design this is quite similar to a [van Leeuwenhoek
microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek) (considered one of the earliest microscopes ever
built) which was used to see microorganisms for the first time in human history. There were a few examples of this
setup, and I spent the first couple hours of the hackathon getting it to work consistently on my phone.

*Above: A few excerpts from a writeup I did on Athelas a few months after the hackathon.*

The real focus of the hack was writing segmentation and template matching approaches, combined with a fast random forest
model implementation that learned to classify extracted versions of the Red Blood Cells (RBCs). Cell boundaries would be
recognized, then fed into the classier to identify whether a parasitical cell (like Malaria or Trypanosoma) was present.

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-6.png" alt="athelas-6" width="1304" height="520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098308" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-6.png)

This made for a fun demo, where a sample slide would have malaria tagged in it, but a normal person‚Äôs blood would not.
While functioning and a neat trick, someone needed to be physically holding the camera in place, the slide had to be
moved around, with the lighting often being hard to fix. At the end of the day it was a nice experimental toy you might
see someone post as a video on Facebook.

But we were sure it could be more. The core idea was - if we made it broad-ranging and easy enough for anyone to use -
why not have a simple blood screen in every doctor‚Äôs office, nursing facility, or even home? After heading back to
school, this idea consumed us and we decided to continue it - but as a product - not just a demo. That meant creating an
automated blood processing mechanism to generate a stained peripheral smear, a more robust computer vision approach for
different cell types, automated mechanisms to image the whole sample without holding the slide in place, and most
importantly - clinical validation.

Deepika (my cofounder) worked to perfect the fast staining mechanism and come up with a way to coat them on plastic
strips that could be ready to use out of the box. She worked mostly in-lab, synthesizing dozens of versions of the stain
compound, and observing empirically the quality of cell rendering. The other side of this problem was ensuring that the
strip could easily be compressed to create a ‚Äòmonolayer‚Äô, or single layer of cells that enables statistically
representative imaging.

*Above: An excerpt from ‚ÄúThe marching velocity of the capillary meniscus in a microchannel‚Äù, a sample of work we
referenced when attempting to model the flow in our channel to generate a monolayer. This capillary design was
eventually shelved for a future iteration.*

In the meantime, I focused on building a higher resolution optical set up in a still cheap, but stand-alone device. As
such, we could focus on monitoring more prevalent cell-types like Leukocytes and Platelets (beyond just malaria). The
heart of it was an actuation system, coupled with gaussian edge autofocusing algorithms to ensure that our cells were
being captured in a consistent fashion. Here‚Äôs a prototype midway through:

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-9.png" alt="athelas-9" width="536" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098311" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-9.png)

Furthermore, we started assembling a training set of data from public CDC images, blood smears collected from
researchers at Stanford and UCSF - often hand labeled by me or a pathologist. From there, we were able to employ
traditional computer vision and deep learning approaches to recognize and classify cell types based on previous,
human-guided examples.

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-10.png" alt="athelas-10" width="1184" height="792" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098312" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-10.png)

*Cell body extraction post hough transform, first pass, pre-segmentation and classification*

The first set of progress was slow. College workload at Stanford + rising costs of our hardware iterations often made it
difficult for us to operate with the iteration speeds a normal product needs. Finals often meant days going by without
any tangible progress whatsoever. But we put together a tangible, usable v1, that could grab images of a stained blood
sample, and process. [See the demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEcx3hx-398).

Then this summer, things came full circle to that orange building in Mountain View, as we joined the summer batch at Y
Combinator. Our time (now full time on the project) was focused on our clinical validation locally and at the FEMAP
family hospital, to run a first set of usages within a hospital system. The goal was proving the system on just one
aspect first: White Blood Cell counts. By grabbing images of samples on our strip, and then running the algorithms we
showed how our counts were correlating with high accuracy to the gold standard Beckman Counter across 350 patients,
combined with [a set of bench precision studies](http://athelas.com/data).

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-11.png" alt="athelas-11" width="1181" height="823" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098313" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-11.png)

An interesting aspect was showing how our drop to drop precision [(something of much recent
interest)](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/86318) was clinically acceptable versus other systems operating on drops.
Coulter counters (traditional cell counting systems) work by flowing particles through a jeweled aperture a few microns
in diameter, and recording impedance to register particle size - and as a result, particle classification. At the crux
of it, [higher impedance = larger particle size](http://www.cyto.purdue.edu/cdroms/cyto2/6/coulter/ss000103.htm).

[<img src="https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-12.png" alt="athelas-12" width="210" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098314" />](https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/athelas-12.png)

Coulter Counting Principle diagram source: [cyto.purdue.edu](http://cyto.purdue.edu)

Athelas‚Äôs computer vision approach, however, focuses wholly on the image and nucleation patterns. As such, the
particulate matter or lymph that can often confuse a Coulter system (especially in diluted quantities), is simply
classified by the vision as a non-leukocyte cellular body (not a white blood cell, but some other, un-classified
artifact in the blood sample).

The trial showed high inter-rater agreement (100% 5-class inter rater agreement) between the two systems, we submitted
our data off to the FDA for Class 2 510k approval, and are now distributing our Class 1 version of the system for rapid
White Blood Cell monitoring. See more at [athelas.com](http://athelas.com).

As we integrate new blood tests into the system over the coming months (concussion monitoring, inflammation tracking,
urinary tract infection, platelets, more cell counts), our key growing challenge will be working with the existing
clinical and medical community to help guide adoption and usage. These coming months will focus on getting our $250

build next on your product: Built For Me, where you design a product for yourself as the most enthusiastic customer;
Switch To Us, where you design a product for a set of existing and potential customers you talk to directly; and Three
Numbers Matter, where you pick three measurable focus areas and iterate over time. In my experience startups progress
through each framework in order, one after another, as the type of challenge shifts.[ Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/) was
a Built For Me startup originally, as we had the idea we wanted to make a live reality TV show and built the underlying
technology for ourselves first. Twitch was Built For Me in the beginning in the same way, as the only part of[
Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/) I really personally enjoyed was the video game streaming. However when we started working
on Twitch in earnest, I relied primarily on Switch To Us because our primary customers were streamers and I wasn‚Äôt a
streamer. Later we developed a Three Numbers Matter approach that's driven most development since.

**Built for me:** You are the primary exemplar user of your own product

  - In many ways, the hardest thing to do is to "know thyself". That's exactly what this requires. You're an
    enthusiastic user of your own product. Deeply introspect and figure out what you wish it did instead. Build that.
    What would you find delightful or fun or useful? Make it happen\!
  - Works best when you truly do love your product. I managed the viewer side of the Twitch experience this way for a
    long time, because I really do love watching Twitch.
  - Works best for small teams. It's hard to communicate intuitive introspective understanding to other people. You can
    create a small team inside of a big company, but it's difficult to get even a medium-sized organization aligned with
    this approach.
  - Works best if you have good intuitive access to your desires. Some people find themselves wanting what they "should"
    want, rather than what they actually want. You need to be able to guess what you‚Äôll truly actually want, not what
    you think you‚Äôre supposed to want. It‚Äôs important to note that ‚ÄúI think I want this because it‚Äôs what I believe I‚Äôm
    supposed to want‚Äù feels subjectively very much like ‚ÄúI want this‚Äù, because human introspection is very unreliable.

**Switch to us:** People are already doing the behavior you want elsewhere, you want them to do it with you instead.

  - Interview as 5-6 dedicated users each from your service, from each competing service, from closely-adjacent
    services. Ask them if they've tried your product, tried multiple products. I‚Äôve included a list of potentially
    useful interview questions at the end of this document.
  - You'll wind up with 50 or so interviews. Categorize the responses and score them in a spreadsheet. Look for
    patterns. Consider doubling down on your strengths, and shoring up obvious weaknesses. Pick stuff that will drive
    switches to your product from competitors. Probably target one competitor at a time. Things you can build or change
    fast are much better than things that take a long time, because customers don‚Äôt care how hard something is to build
    just how effective it is for their problem. But don‚Äôt shy away from hard problems if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs necessary.
  - The key to running effective interviews is to use the interviews to understand the problem, and based on what you
    learn to generate ideas for solving it. Validating an idea you already have is an anti-goal. You can‚Äôt improve an
    idea through any amount of validation. The goal of this process is to have better ideas as much as it is to
    prioritize them. If you generate your ideas from the problems and opportunities your customers face, you‚Äôll have
    better ideas and a stronger intuitive sense of their priority. I did a talk on how to do this effectively:[
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk)
  - Works best when your product is very important to your customers. Streamers on Twitch have strong opinions about
    what makes a good streaming service that they can articulate very clearly and where they can weight tradeoffs. They
    think like "prosumers" or "SMBs" rather than consumers. Vs. say SnapChat, where the average user may have no idea
    what it is about SnapChat that they like exactly. Why do I find reddit so addictive? The reddit PMs might know, but
    I certainly don't.
  - Works best when you're selling a better mousetrap, rather than inventing the mousetrap category. Twitch was a better
    mousetrap for streamers on other streaming services, we weren't inventing live streaming as a category. Wouldn't
    have worked for us at[ Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/) when there were no existing live streamers because we were the
    first live streaming service.

**Three numbers matter:** There are a few key drivers that make using your product better or worse.

  - Talk to your customers, look at the data, and identify the three most important qualities of the product for your
    customer. For Amazon, for example, the three drivers are lower prices, more selection of products, and faster/more
    reliable shipping. Amazon focuses on finding ways to drive down prices, add new categories of products or new
    versions of products, and improving the speed and convenience of shipping. Of course other things matter too, but
    ideas that move those three things are given priority for product progress. At Twitch, our three metrics are
    audience size, positive interactions, and money. Twitch focuses on ways to help streamers grow the size of their
    audience, interact with that audience in more fun and connected ways, and earn more money per viewer.
  - Three is a magic number for focus. The truth is that your product is complex and there are many things you need to
    improve and it‚Äôs always tempting to add focus areas. Empirically, three seems to be the maximum number of focus
    areas that people can keep in mind consistently. Think about how lists like ‚ÄúX, Y, and Z‚Äù feels natural, but ‚ÄúW, X,
    Y, and Z‚Äù does not.
  - You can have a bonus fourth focus area as well: Stuff You Have To Do. PCI compliance is usually not a company focus,
    but failing it as a payment processor will still kill you. Your product needs to stay up, enough downtime will kill
    you. You can probably think of dozens of more examples. This stuff needs to be done and should be done, but should
    not be included in the top level three metrics.
  - This approach tends to be recursive. There are 3 metrics that matter at the top level. Driving each of those metrics
    can be further decomposed, and each can have 3 sub-drivers.
  - You'll wind up with three areas of investment. Come up with a metric for each (these will evolve over time...revisit
    them every few months), and start trying to move it. Choose your split by intuition...maybe it's 33/33/33, maybe
    it's 50/25/25, depends if you think one area is more important right now.
  - Works best when people choose your product for measurable reasons (price, audience size, speed) and almost not at
    all when people choose your product for difficult-to-measure ones (fun, connection, love, community). Good for
    making utilitarian things, less good for making games and toys and beautiful UX.
  - Operational excellence (good uptime, efficient use of employee labor, security, etc) is important for every company.
    But for a startup, it‚Äôs rare that you can win through pure operational excellence. Usually you need to do just
    enough operational excellence that it‚Äôs acceptable to your customers, and then focus on delivering on what your
    customers really care about. Sometimes one of the primary values for your company is that it‚Äôs low latency, or high
    security, or super reliable, and that aspect of operational excellence becomes a key goal. But even then, most
    aspects of operational excellence need to be run on a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù basis early on.

While Twitch has been running primarily on a Three Numbers Matter approach, we go back to Switch To Us periodically for
new customer segments. For example, as we started working to launch our new music category, we started talking to
artists who livestreamed elsewhere online to understand what their needs were. Solving for those needs drove our
roadmap, rather than a metric driven Three Numbers Matter approach. As the category grows, we have begun to identify the
set of metrics that matter most for us and we will begin to transition towards Three Numbers Matter instead.

Certain problems don't fit any of these frameworks. What do you do if you're building a brand new mousetrap, which
people like your product for difficult-to-measure reasons, and you're not the end-user of it yourself? It's really
really hard\! So these constrain the space of problems where it's possible to build good stuff reliably. This constrains
big companies more than small ones, due to the difficulty of scaling up Built For Me. So you either find big companies
working on products where the important drivers are easy to measure, or you find them working on incremental innovation
in existing categories. Unless of course, the CEO is the lead designer like Steve Jobs at Apple, where you get a big
company escaping the dilemma and doing ground-breaking category creation for a product that's great for
difficult-to-measure reasons. The ongoing popularity of ‚Äúhack day‚Äù or ‚Äúhack week‚Äù within larger organizations fits into
this framework as well. Hack week is all about unleashing the Built For Me capacity latent inside any organization, by
reverting to a more startup-like approach with small teams and intuitive decisions. This also explains why a lot of the
biggest startups (though certainly not all) started with the Built For Me approach. It gives you an automatic advantage
against big incumbents who can't use the same method.

**Good Interview Questions for Switch To Us:**

  - What do you like about your current solution?
  - What don‚Äôt you like about it?
  - How did you wind up choosing your current solution?
  - What were you doing before?
  - What would you do if you were the CEO of the current company‚Äôs product you‚Äôre using?
  - What‚Äôs the single most annoying thing about your current solution?
  - What‚Äôs the single coolest new thing about your current solution?
  - Is there anything that would convince you to switch to using our product immediately if we built it? If so, what is
    it?
  - If you had a magic wand and could create any experience you wanted in this area, how would it work?
  - What‚Äôs one thing about your current solution that‚Äôs surprisingly hard?
  - Remember to follow up with ‚Äúinteresting, tell me more‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy is that?‚Äù or ‚Äúcan you elaborate?‚Äù as appropriate.
    People know more than they think they do, they just need a good interviewer to draw it out of them.
