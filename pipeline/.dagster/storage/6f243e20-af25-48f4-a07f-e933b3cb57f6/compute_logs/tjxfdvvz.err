one blocker is that they don‚Äôt have an idea. At some point during their formative years they learned that every great
startup started with a great idea and if the idea isn‚Äôt amazing (usually as judged by peers, parents, or other people
with little startup experience), the startup will fail.

My first startup‚Äôs idea (really Justin Kan‚Äôs idea) was to create a live reality TV show where people would walk around
with cameras on their head livestreaming their lives 24/7. This company eventually became Twitch.tv and sold to Amazon
for almost a billion dollars (thanks to some amazing work by Emmett Shear, Kevin Lin, and a great group of employees).
Airbnb started with the idea that when you want to attend a conference, sometimes all the hotels in that city are sold
out. Therefore, wouldn‚Äôt it be great to have a site where you can find an airbed to crash on. In 2017 over 200 million
nights were booked on Airbnb, [almost none of them fitting the original purpose of the
site](https://press.atairbnb.com/the-u-s-midwest-ryokans-and-brazilian-beaches-airbnbs-2018-travel-trends/).

I‚Äôd like to offer an alternative to the conventional ‚Äúgreat idea‚Äù theory of startups for first time founders to
consider. This guide can help you walk the path from nothing to a launched minimal viable product (MVP). This is by no
means the only path to an MVP and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the best path, but it is a path that I‚Äôve seen work for a number
of YC companies.

## The Order of Operations

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd start: Is there any particular problem that you are passionate about? For younger founders, that
problem can come from your experience growing up, from your family/friends, your personal interests, or from school. For
older founders it could also come from experiences at work, being married, or being someone‚Äôs partner. For the Airbnb
founders, their original problem was how to pay rent. For Justin.tv/Twitch the original problem Justin and Emmett had
was what startup should we work on next. Some problems seem important and impactful at the beginning and others feel
like trivial toys. I‚Äôve seen both types grow into billion dollar companies.

Once you decide on a problem, find some friends and brainstorm potential solutions to the problem. Those friends can be
other people who also have the same problem but they don‚Äôt have to be. They can be people you went to school with,
people from work, or people you‚Äôve met in your personal life. What‚Äôs probably most important is that you pick friends
who are smart and fun to brainstorm with. When someone is fun to brainstorm with - instead of rejecting potential
solutions as they are said aloud - they riff on the solutions and improve upon them. If you‚Äôre not technical I‚Äôd
encourage you to brainstorm with friends/colleagues who are. If you pick the correct friends to talk to, sometimes the
result of this brainstorm is a solution or idea that you can get really excited about. This is the spark that can make
your startup come alive. Because the people you brainstormed with feel some ownership for the solution you came up with
together, this is the perfect time to ask them to work with you to actually build that solution. A great brainstorm can
often not only provide you with an idea, it can also provide you with co-founders (so pick your brainstorming partners
carefully).<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

At this point the most important thing to make that spark turn into a fire is to work together to build and launch a
minimal viable product (MVP). An MVP is the smallest possible product you can build that allows you to start offering
your service to users. Often times you need very little software to start. Resist the temptation to build your complete
solution because in reality you have no idea whether it will work. Better to build an extremely stripped down version of
your solution and start seeing if users actually want to use it. Airbnb‚Äôs first version had almost no features (no map
view, no profiles, no messaging, no payments, etc) and they referred to it as ‚ÄúAirbnb Lite‚Äù and built it in under a
month. It‚Äôs totally okay if you need to do a bunch of manual work that doesn‚Äôt scale on the backend, is users actually
want what you are making you‚Äôll have time to fix everything and make it scale later. Once you have your first users of
any kind, you have a startup. That being said, you still need someone with the technical skills to ship the MVP.

Once you‚Äôve put your MVP together, there‚Äôs a ton of startup advice to follow. Here are a few resources I recommend:

  - [YC‚Äôs Essential Advice](https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-essential-startup-advice/)
  - [Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
  - [Blog Pmarca](https://pmarchive.com/)

## Two Failed Orders of Operations

There are a couple of paths I see first time founders walk that often lead them to failure.

**1) Come up with an idea and then pitch investors.**  
Usually these founders think that investors, by investing, will validate their idea and that if they can‚Äôt raise money -
they don‚Äôt have a good idea. Good investors are interested in teams who are actually in the process of executing their
idea and tend to shy away from teams that are just pitching their idea.

**2) I have an idea but can‚Äôt write code and none of my co-founders can either.**  
These founders want to pay someone else to build their product. Then they‚Äôll launch it, try to raise money, and build
out a tech team. The problem there is that good investors are actually investing in the team you‚Äôve built. If you are
building a tech startup and no one on your team can write code or do the technical work necessary, the bar to raise
investment is much much higher. In my experience you have to have 10x the amount of traction to get a good investor to
overlook a non-technical team. Also, in general the problem with outsourcing engineering is that the people you
outsource aren‚Äôt as motivated as you are and are often fairly expensive.

## Counterexamples

There are a lot of counterexamples to the ‚Äúfailure‚Äù scenarios I described above, both for first time and repeat
founders. What I will tell you is that building a successful startup is extremely hard and when you choose to follow one
of the failure paths - often your road is much harder and less likely to lead to success. Why make things more painful
on yourself?

By no means do I think this is the only path but when founders ask me to recommend a path, this is the one I recommend.
It‚Äôs the most effective one I‚Äôve seen in getting founders past the first major hurdles of putting something out and
finding initial funding.

**Note**  
<b id="footnote1">1.</b> Now, what if you‚Äôre not technical and don‚Äôt have access to technical people? Often what I tell
future founders is go work at a startup and make those friends. At the end of the day, having the right founding team is
such a fast track to to building a successful startup that it‚Äôs worth investing a year or two building those
relationships before you start.[‚Ü©](#footnoteid1)

Founders often ask how they should split equity with their co-founders.When I search the web on this topic I often see
horrible advice, typically advocating for significant inequality among different founding team members. We see this
trend reflected in the thousands of applications we review at Y Combinator every year.

Here are some of the most often cited reasons for unequal equity splits:

  - I came up with the idea for the company
  - I started working *n* months before my co-founder
  - This is what we agreed to
  - My co-founder took a salary for *n* months and I didn't
  - I started working full time *n* months before my co-founder
  - I am older/more experienced than my co-founder
  - I brought on my co-founder after raising *n* thousands of dollars
  - I brought on my co-founder after launching my MVP
  - We need someone to tie-break in the case of founder arguments

**Founders tend to make the mistake of splitting equity based on early work.**

All of these lines of reasoning screw up in four fundamental ways:

  - **It takes 7 to 10 years to build a company of great value.** Small variations in year one do not justify massively
    different founder equity splits in year 2-10.
  - **More equity = more motivation.** Almost all startups fail. The more motivated the founders, the higher the chance
    of success. Getting a larger piece of the equity pie is worth nothing if the lack of motivation on your founding
    team leads to failure.
  - **If you don‚Äôt value your co-founders, neither will anyone else.** Investors look at founder equity split as a cue
    on how the CEO values his/her co-founders. If you only give a co-founder 10% or 1%, others will either think they
    aren't very good or aren't going to be very impactful in your business. The quality of the team is often one of the
    top reasons why an investor will or won‚Äôt invest. Why communicate to investors that you have a team that you don‚Äôt
    highly value?
  - **Startups are about execution, not about ideas.** Dramatically unequal founder equity splits often give undue
    preference to the co-founder who initially came up with the idea for the startup, as opposed to the small group
    founders who got the product to market and generated the initial traction.

**Equity should be split equally (or near equally) because all the work is ahead of you.**

My advice for splitting equity is probably controversial, but it's what we have done for all of my startups, and what we
almost always recommend at YC: equal (or close to equal) equity splits among co-founders. \[1\] These are the people you
are going to war with. You will spend more time with these people than you will with most family members. These are the
people who will help you decide the most important questions in your company. Finally, these are the people you will
celebrate with when you succeed.

I believe equal or close to equal equity splits among founding teams should become standard. If you aren't willing to
give your partner an equal share, then perhaps you are choosing the wrong partner.

*Thank you to Justin Kan, Qasar Younis, and Colleen Taylor for reading drafts of this essay*

Notes:

\[1\] If you fear what will happen if you have to break up with a co-founder, make sure you have a proper vesting
schedule. In the Valley, a typical setup is to have four years of vesting with a one year ‚Äúcliff.‚Äù In other words, while
you might own 50% of the company on paper, if you leave or get fired within a year you walk away with nothing. After the
one year point you get 25% of your stock. Every month after that you get an additional 1/48th of your total stock. You
only earn all of your stock at the end of four years. This ensures that founders are a good fit for the long haul -- and
if there is a problem you can fix it without harm in year one. Another good contingency measure is for only the CEO to
hold a board seat before a significant equity fundraise. That will prevent board disputes during tough decisions, such
as in the unlikely event that the CEO has to fire a co-founder.
